## Deployment Models

When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as required cloud application components, preferred resource management tools, and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements.

### Cloud-Based

All existing applications are migrated to the cloud, or you design and build new applications in the cloud. Companies do not have to manage and maintain their own hardware and data centers.

### On-Premises (Private Cloud)

Resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools. Companies hosted and maintained hardware such as compute, storage, and networking equipment in their own data centers.

### Hybrid

Cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. This approach might be useful if you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises.
