## Deployment Models

When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as required cloud application components, preferred resource management tools, and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements.

### Cloud-Based

All existing applications are migrated to the cloud, or you design and build new applications in the cloud.

### On-Premises (Private Cloud)

Resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.

### Hybrid

Cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. This approach might be useful if you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises.
