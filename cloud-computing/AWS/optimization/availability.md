## Availability

The availability of a system is typically expressed as a percentage of uptime in a given year i.e. 90%, 99.995%, etc.

### Active-passive

with an active-passive system, only one of the two instances is available at a time. This is useful for stateful applications i.e. storing client's session. However, this system is not scalable.

### Active-active

Both servers are available and hence, can perform load balancing. Works better for stateless applications.

## Elasticity

Once a system is scalable, elasticity means that there will be some '**auto-scaling**' so that the system can scale based on the load/demand. Elasticity is cloud-friendly i.e. pay-per-use, match demand, optimizing costs, etc.

## Agility

Agility refers to the speed at which you access new IT resources, and hence you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers i.e. from weeks to minutes.
