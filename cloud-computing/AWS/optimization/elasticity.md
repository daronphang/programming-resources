## Elasticity

Once a system is scalable, elasticity means that there will be some '**auto-scaling**' so that the system can scale based on the load/demand i.e ability to handle bursts of traffic. Elasticity is cloud-friendly i.e. pay-per-use, match demand, optimizing costs, etc.

## Agility

Agility refers to the speed at which you access new IT resources, and hence you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers i.e. from weeks to minutes.
