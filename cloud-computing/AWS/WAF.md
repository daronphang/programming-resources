## Well-Architectured Framework (WAF)

The AWS WAF consists of 6 pillars that help you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.

### Security

The Security pillar is the ability to protect information, systems and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

### Reliability

Reliability is the ability of a system to do the following:

- Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
- Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
- Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
- Cognizant of how change affects a system (change management)

Reliability includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure. Services include Trusted Advisor and Service Quotas.

### Performance efficiency

Performance efficiency is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technology evolve.

### Cost optimization

Cost optimization is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

Cost optimization includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.

### Operational excellence

Operational excellence is the ability to run workloads effectively, monitor systems to deliver business value, and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures by gaining insights into the operations.

Design principles in the cloud includes performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.

### Sustainability

Sustainability is the ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by **maximizing** the benefits from the provisioned resources and **minimizing** the total resources required.
