## SQS (Simple Queue Service)

SQS is a message queuing service. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.

In SQS, an application sends messages into the queue. A user or service retrieves a message from the queue, processes it, and then deletes it from the queue.
