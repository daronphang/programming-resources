## EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute)

Provides compute capacity in the cloud that is secure and resizable based on the user's requirements. Web service that allows developers to rent VMs and automatically scales the compute capacity when required.

Offers various instance types so that developers can choose required resources including CPU, memory, storage and networking capacity.

## Lambda

Serveless compute service that is responsible for executing code on schedule. No need for provisioning and managing servers, and executes code only when required (pay only for compute time).

With serverless computing, you can focus more on innovating new products and features instead of maintaining servers. Another benefit is the flexibility to scale serverless applications automatically.

### How Lambda Works

1. You upload code to Lambda
2. Set your code to trigger from an event source i.e. HTTP endpoints, AWS services
3. Lambda runs your code only when triggered
4. You pay only for the compute time you use

## Elastic Beanstalk

Helps to scale and deploy web applications made with several programming languages. EBS handles the deployment of the code as soon as it is uploaded.

## Lightsail

Enables a VPS to be launched and managed with ease.

## ECS (Elastic Container Service)

Containers provide you a standard way to package your application's code and dependencies into a single object. You can use containers for processes and workflows in which there are essential requirements for security, reliability and scalability.

AWS ECS is a highly scalable, high-performance container management system that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS.

ECS supports Docker containers. You can use API calls to launch and stop Docker-enabled applications.

## EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

AWS EKS is a fully managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS.

## Fargate

AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both ECS and EKS.

When using Fargate, you don't need to provision or manage servers. AWS Fargate manages your server infrastructure for you.
