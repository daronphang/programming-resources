## AWS Management Console

A web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services. The console includes wizards and automated workflows that can simplify the process of completing tasks.

## AWS CLI

AWS CLI enables you to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool. Available for users on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

By using AWS CLI, you can automate the actions that your services and applications perform through scripts.

An alternative is using **AWS CloudShell**, but is only available in certain Regions.

## SDKs (Software Development Kits)

SDKs make it easier for you to use AWS services through an API designed for your programming language or platform. SDKs enable you to use AWS services with your existing applications or create entirely new applications that will run on AWS.

AWS provides documentation and sample code for each supported programming language (C++, Java, .NET, etc).
