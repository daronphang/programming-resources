## Shared Responsibility Model

Both the customer and AWS are responsible for keeping AWS resources secure. The reason is that you do not treat your AWS environment as a single object. Instead, you treat the environment as a collection of parts that build upon each other.

Customers are responsible for security **in** the cloud i.e. everything that they create and put in the AWS cloud. The customer must maintain complete control over their content:

- Customer data
- Platform, applications, Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Operating systems, network and firewall configuration
- Client-side data encryption, server-side data encryption, network traffic protection

AWS is responsible for security **of** the cloud. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components at all layers of the infrastructure. Although you cannot visit the data centers, AWS provides reports from third-party auditors. AWS manages the physical infrastructure that hosts your resources:

- Software i.e. compute, storage, database, networking
- Hardware i.e. Regions, Availability Zones, Edge Locations
