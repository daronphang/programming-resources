## AWS Outposts

AWS S3 Outposts delivers object storage to your on-premises AWS Outposts environment. They are 'server racks' that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs and tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud.

It is a pool of AWS compute and storage capacity deployed at a customer site. AWS monitors, operates, and manages this capacity as part of an AWS Region.

It is designed to store data durably and redundantly across multiple devices and servers on your Outposts. It works well for workloads with local data residency requirements that must satisfy demanding performance needs by keeping data close to on-premise applications.
