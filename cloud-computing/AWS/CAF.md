## Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)

The AWS CAF organizes guidance into six areas of focus called **Perspectives**. Each Perspective addresses distinct responsibilities. In general, the Business, People and Governance Perspectives focus on **business** capabilities, whereas the Platform, Security and Operations Perspectives focus on **technical** capabilities.

### Business Perspective

The Business perspective helps ensure that your cloud investments accelerate your digital transformation ambitions and business outcomes.

The Business perspective ensures that IT aligns with business needs and that IT investments link to key business results i.e. integrating IT strategy into a business model.

The People perspective supports development of an organization-wide change management strategy for successful cloud adoption.

The People perspective serves as a bridge between technology and business, accelerating the cloud journey to help organizations more rapidly evolve to a culture of continuous growth, learning, and where change becomes business-as-normal, with focus on culture, organizational structure, leadership, and workforce.

Use this to evaluate organizational structures and roles, new skill and process requirements, and identify gaps. This helps prioritize training, staffing, and organizational changes. Helps HR prepare their teams for cloud adoption by updating organizational processes and staff skills to include cloud-base competencies.
