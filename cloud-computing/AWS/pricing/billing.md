## AWS Billing & Cost Management dashboard

Use the AWS Billing & Cost Management dashboard to pay your AWS bill, monitor your usage, and analyze and control your costs.

## Consolidated billing

AWS Organizations provides the option for consolidated billing i.e. receive a single bill for all AWS accounts in your organization. **The default maximum number of accounts allowed for an organization is 4**, but you can contact AWS Support to increase your quota, if needed.

Another benefit is the ability to share bulk discount pricing, Savings Plans, and Reserved Instances across the accounts in your organization. For instance, one account may not have enough monthly usage to qualify for discount pricing. However, when multiple accounts are combined, their aggregated usage may qualify for this benefit.

## AWS Budgets

In AWS Budgets, you can create budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.

The information in AWS Budgets updates **three times a day**. This helps you to accurately determine how close your usage is to your budgeted amounts or to the AWS Free Tier limits.

You can set custom alerts that will notify you when your service usage exceeds the amount you have budgeted. your budget can be based on cost or usage.

## AWS Cost Explorer

AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report of the costs and usage for your top five cost-accruing AWS services. You can apply custom filters and groups to analyze your data.
