## Migration Strategies

### Rehosting (lift and shift)

Rehosting involves moving applications without changes.

### Replatforming (lift, tinker and shift)

Replatforming involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit.
Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application.

### Refactoring

Refactoring involves reimagining how an application is architectured and developed by using cloud-native features. Refactoring is driven by a **strong business need** to add features, scale or performance that would otherwise be **difficult to achieve** in the application's existing environment.

### Repurchasing

Repurchasing involves moving from a traditional license to a SaaS model i.e. customer relationship management (CRM) system to Salesforce.

### Retaining

Retaining consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment i.e. applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated.

### Retiring

Retiring is the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.
