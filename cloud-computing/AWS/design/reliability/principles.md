## Design principles for resilience

- Ability to recover from disruption is the main component of reliability
- Plan for failure and how you are going to respond e.g. datacenters, disks, computers, networks, VPN, etc.
- Automate your recovery as much as possible
- Prevent capacity outages through scaling
- Test everything e.g. chaos engineering
- Use only the availability you need i.e. don't over-engineer
- Measure everything and put everything into writing on all SLAs/SLOs/OKRs/etc.
