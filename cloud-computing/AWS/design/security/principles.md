## Design principles of security

### Strong identity management

Implement a strong process and foundation for managing users, groups, roles and access.

### Apply security at all layers

Defend in layers and in depth by activating security inside-out:

1. Public firewall
2. Network defense
3. Private firewall
4. Host firewall

### Prepare for security events

Be prepared for your response to incursion, breaches, and other security events.

### Track everything relevant

Maintain logs, information, state, and configuration for all relevant or significant paths to relevant resources.

### Reduce direct contact

Keep humans away from your processes, resources, and data as much as possible. When having them is necessary, use indirect tooling to get to the resource.

### Automate best practices

Put as many useful automated checks as you can to check for issues, holes, prevention, detection, etc.

### Protect data in all states

Protect your data in-transit, at-rest, and all states in between.
