## Design principles for costs

### Implement cloud financial management

- Build the capability to track finances
- Make this every team's responsibility

### Measure overall efficiency

- Balance business need and IT spend
- Measure the value/revenue of the application to the business
- Compare that to the cost and output with cloud

### Adopt a consumption model

- Only create resources when you need to consume them
- Use event-driven or spot-driven consumption models where possible
- Don't let any AWS resource sit idle

### Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting

- Spend time on things that make your business special
- Don't solve the same IT problems that everyone else is solving
- Let AWS do that for you and focus on what makes your business different

### Analyze and attribute expenditure

- AWS will show you everything that you are already paying for
- Assign costs to projects
