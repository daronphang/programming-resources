## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources (hardware, storage, databases, networking and software) to businesses and individuals via a network. Enables organizations to access and store information without managing their own physical devices or IT infrastructure (software than hardware).

Cloud services are also typically managed and maintained by third-party providers, allowing IT teams to rapidly adjust compute and storage without having to pay upfront infrastructure costs.

### Service Models

- IaaS: on-demand access to compute, storage, networking resources
- PaaS: hardware and software resources needed for cloud application development
- SaaS: full-application stack as a cloud service, including maintenance and management from underlying infrastructure to application software
