## Kafka Connect

Kafka Connect is a component of Kafka that provides data integration between databases, key-value stores, search indexes, file systems and Kafka brokers. Kafka Connect provides a common framework for you to define connectors, which do the work of moving data in and out of Kafka.

There are two different types of connectors:

- Source connectors that act as producers for Kafka
- Sink connectors that act as consumers for Kafka
