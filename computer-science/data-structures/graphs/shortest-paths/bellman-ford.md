## Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Solves single-source shortest-paths problem in the general case in which edges can have negative weight. Is simple and has the further benefit of detecting whether a negative-weight cycle is reachable from the source by returning a boolean value. If there is such cycle, the algorithm indicates that no solution exists. Has time complexity of O(VE).

Uses dynamic programming to solve the problem in bottom-up manner i.e. first calculcates the shortest distances which have at-most one edge in the path, then it calculcates the shortest path with at-most two edges, and etc.

## Algorithm

```
bellmanFord(G,w,s){
    initializeSingleSource(G,s)
    for i=1 to |G.V| - 1
        for each edge (u,v) E G.E
            // G.E is a set of all the edges, iterates through each of them
            // for each pass, each edge is relaxed once
            relax(u,v,w)

    // check if graph contains no negative-weight cycles
    for each edge (u,v) E G.E
        if v.d > u.d + w(u,v)
            return FALSE
    return TRUE
}
```
