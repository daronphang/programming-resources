## Floyd-Warshall

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm finds the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights, as long as there are no negative cycles. Unlike algorithms that compute shortest paths from a single source, Floyd-Warshall computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph.

This algorithm takes a fundamentally different approach by computing all-pairs shortest paths in one go, rather than separately for each source. We start by initializing a distance matrix where direct connections between cities are filled with their edge weights, and all other distances are set to infinity. The distance from a city to itself is set to zero. This matrix serves both as our working space and our final result.

The core of the our algorithm involves three nested loops. The outermost loop iterates through all vertices, considering each as a potential intermediate point on the shortest path between every other pair of vertices. For each pair of vertices (i, j), we check if passing through the current intermediate vertex k offers a shorter path than we currently know. If it does, we update the distance.

This iterative process gradually refines our shortest paths. By the time all vertices have been considered as intermediates, we have determined all shortest paths. After running Floyd-Warshall, our distance matrix contains all the information needed. We can directly count reachable cities for each source and select our answer, similar to previous approaches.

Floyd-Warshall has several advantages: it solves the all-pairs shortest path problem directly with a simple and elegant one-pass implementation. For dense graphs, its time complexity of O(V^3) can be more efficient than running algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s or SPFA multiple times. However, for sparse graphs or when only a few sources are involved, other algorithms might be more efficient.

### Algorithm

This algorithm considers all vertices as an intermediate vertex. For every vertex pair (i,j):

- k is not an intermediate in shortest path from i to j
- k is an intermediate; d(i,j) is updated if > d(i,k) + d(k,j)

Time complexity is O(n^3) as it involves three nested for loops. Thought it has same time complexity as Dijkstra's, it will be faster as it performs fewer instructions per loop.
