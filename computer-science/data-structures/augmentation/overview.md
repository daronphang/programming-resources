### Augmenting Data Structures

Some engineering situations require no more than a "textbook" data structure i.e. doubly linked list, hash table, or BST, but many others suffice to augment a data structure by storing additional information in it. You can then program new operations for the data structure to support the desired application.

The process of augmenting a data structure to support additional functionality occurs quite frequently in algorithm design. The process can be broken down into four steps:

1. Choose an underlying data structure.
2. Determine additional information to maintain in the underlying data structure.
3. Verify that we can maintain the additional information for basic modifying operations on the underlying data structure.
4. Develop new operations for purpose of augmenting a data structure.
