### Fibonacci Heaps

Structure is more flexible and efficient and hence, allows to have better time complexities but come at cost of more complexity:

- Trees do not have fixed shape.
- In worst case, every element in heap can be in a separate tree.
- Roots of all trees are stored using a circular doubly linked list.
- Efficiency is achieved by performing many operations in lazy manner.
