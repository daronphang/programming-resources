## Linked Lists vs Arrays

| Arrays                                                                                                         | Linked Lists                                                                                                                                    |

| A collection of elements of similar data type.                                                                 | An ordered collection of elements of same type, connected to each other using pointers.                                                         |
| Supports Random Access by indexing. Has time complexity of O(1).                                               | Supports Sequential Access and requires traversing the linked list. Has time complexity of O(n).                                                |
| Elements are stored in contiguous memory location. Size needs to be declared and cannot be altered at runtime. | Data exist at scattered (non-contiguous) addresses which allows dynamic size at runtime. Address of memory location is stored in previous node. |
| Elements are independent of each other.                                                                        | Elements are dependent on each other.                                                                                                           |
| Insertion and deletion takes more time as memory locations are consecutive and fixed.                          | Insertion and deletion are fast and take constant time.                                                                                         |
| Memory is allocated as soon it is declared at compile time i.e. Static Memory Allocation.                      | Memory is allocated at runtime i.e. Dynamic Memory Allocation.                                                                                  |
| Array gets memory allocated in Stack.                                                                          | Linked list gets memory allocated in Heap.                                                                                                      |
| Memory utilization is inefficient i.e. if size is 6 but consists of 3 elements.                                | Memory utilization is efficient as it can be allocated/deallocated at runtime.                                                                  |
