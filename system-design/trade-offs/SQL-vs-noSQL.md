## SQL vs NoSQL

- A record in SQL conforms to a fixed schema, while schemas are dynamic in NoSQL
- SQL databases are vertically scalable, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
- NoSQL databases are optimized for read-heavy and write-heavy operations
- SQL support ACID transactions (data integrity) while NoSQL sacrifice ACID compliance for performance and scalability
