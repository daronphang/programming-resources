## SQL

- Relational databases store data in rows and columns
- Each record conforms to a fixed schema
- Powerful for complex queries and joining data from multiple tables
- Vertically scalable
- ACID compliant (data integrity)

## NoSQL

- NoSQL databases have different data storage models: key-value, document, graph, and columnar
- Schemas in NoSQL are dynamic
- Horizontally scalable
- Sacrifices ACID compliance for performance and scalability
