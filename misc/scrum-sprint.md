## Overview

Scrum provides a framework for completing projects effectively. Within the Scrum framework, teams employ sprints to break down complex project components into smaller tasks to complete during specific time frames. While sprints are necessary processes within the Scrum framework, there are several differences between the processes.

## Scrum

Scrum is a type of framework professionals use when implementing the Agile methodology to complete software development projects. The Scrum framework operates as an iterative software design that allows project managers to establish team roles, responsibilities, collaborative meeting schedules and required tools. With the Scrum framework, these criteria never change. Scrum meetings to collaborate on progress and performance support productivity and successful outcomes.

You can run a Scrum to define the specifications for each project you initiate with your team, then break the entire Scrum process down into sprints. Several key aspects of Scrum that make it an effective framework for implementing the Agile methodology of software development include:

- Small teams of up to 10 individuals
- Sprints that direct smaller processes for short time frames
- Collaborative meetings to support and improve ongoing processes

## Sprint

A sprint is a process within the Scrum framework that divides project workflow into time-box iterations. Sprints typically take about two weeks to complete. When a sprint is currently in progress, development teams collaborate during the Scrum meeting to track progress and integrate modifications if improvements are necessary. At the end of a sprint, development teams conduct a sprint review to evaluate completed work and reflect on the wins and losses throughout the project. Teams then use feedback and input from sprint reviews to plan and strategize for the next iteration within an entire software development project.

## Scrum vs Sprint

### Objectives

One of the biggest differences between an entire Scrum framework and individual sprints within the process is the purpose or objective. When following the Scrum framework, the objective is to establish the necessary project criteria in the roles, meeting dates, required tools and project timelines you set for your team.

During a sprint, however, the objective is to initiate, complete and deliver software products to provide ongoing delivery of software packages to clients throughout an entire software development application. So when you set the objectives for the Scrum process, it's important these objectives define the overall project parameters, while a sprint objective gives direction for teams to complete each phase of the project.

### Timelines

The timelines between Scrum and sprint also differ. While project managers apply the Scrum framework when initiating and directing large software development projects, each Sprint within the framework only lasts one to two weeks, depending on the project parameters. This means an entire software development project can take months to complete within Scrum, while each sprint within the framework occurs within shorter time frames.

### Processes

The Scrum framework outlines the entire project process from initiation to completion. Since the Scrum framework manages large-scale software development projects, it encompasses multiple processes where teams can break each process down into a sprint. Development teams use Scrum to outline key roles, responsibilities and tools and to establish consistent meeting schedules to review smaller processes within the framework. A sprint, though, is one individual process within the numerous phases of the Scrum framework.

### Outcomes

Although the overall result of initiating projects using Scrum is to produce a deliverable software product, the outcomes during each sprint session can differ. Each sprint can have its own outcome, where teams can produce a small sample of a larger software application, an element of a software suite or components from software packages. When you complete projects at the end of a Scrum implementation, the outcome is the entire software product.

### Measurement

Measuring progress and evaluating the success of each process within the Scrum framework and throughout each sprint require different approaches. During each sprint, teams perform inspections to measure overall progress towards each objective. In addition to constant inspections, development teams conduct daily scrum meetings to discuss completed and remaining work within a sprint. Scrum measurements occur throughout various times during software development and ultimately support the end goal of product release.
