## Services

Used to expose Pods to the network. Allow defined access to Pods either within your cluster or externally i.e. a Service is a set of Pods which can be reached by a fixed DNS name or IP address.

An abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and policy by which to access them, and this abstraction allows Pods to die and replicate in Kubernetes without impacting your application. Defined using YAML or JSON, and enables a loose coupling between dependent Pods.

Although each Pod has a unique IP address, they are not exposed outside the cluster, and a Service is required to route traffic across the Pods. Can be exposed in different ways by specifying a type.

```console
$ kubectl expose deployment/nginx â€“port 80
$ kubectl expose deployment/httpenv --port 8888 --type LoadBalancer

$ kubectl get services
$ curl [IP_address_of_service]:8888

$ # for Windows:=
$ kubectl --generator=run-pod/v1 tmp-shell --rm -it --image bredfisher/netshoot -- bash
$ curl httpenv:8888
```

### Communication between Containers

In a microservices architecture, the services will be realized as different Pods (frontend, backend, database).

- Containers in the same Pod can connect with each other using localhost, but using different port number.
- Container in a Pod can communicate with another by directly addressing its IP address (brittle approach as Pods are dispensable and can be restarted).
- Recommended approach between containers in different Pods is through Services, and can connect by using DNS name.

### Ingress

Ingresses are closely related objects and are used to set up HTTP routes to Services via a load balancer. Also support HTTPS traffic secured by TLS certificates.

### ClusterIP

Default service type. Single, internal virtual IP allocated. Only reachable from within cluster (nodes and pods).

### NodePort

Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node in the cluster using NAT. Superset of ClusterIP.

```
<NodeIP>:<NodePort>
```

### LoadBalancer

Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud (only available when infrastructure/cloud provider gives LB) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service. Superset of NodePort i.e. creates NodePort and ClusterIP Services.

### ExternalName

Maps the Service to an external name i.e. foo.bar.example.com, by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxy is setup. Not used for pods but for giving pods a DNS name to use outside Kubernetes.

## Port Forwarding

Can access a Service without binding it by using Kubectl's integrated port-forwarding functionality. Works without Services i.e. can directly conenct to a Pod in your deployment.

```console
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/nginx 8080:80
$ kubectl port-forward service/nginx 8080:80
```
