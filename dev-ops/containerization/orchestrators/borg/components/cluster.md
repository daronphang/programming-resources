## Cluster

The machines in a cell belong to a single cluster, defined by the high-performance datacenter-scale network fabric that connects them. A cluster lives inside a single datacenter building, and a collection of buildings makes up a site.

A cluster usually hosts one large cell and may have a few smaller-scale test or special-purpose cells.
