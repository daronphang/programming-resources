## Cell

A Borg cell is a set of machines that are managed as a unit. Borg cells run a heterogenous workload with two main parts: batch and serving jobs. The workload mix varies across cells, which run different mixes of applications depending on their major tenants (some cells are quite batch-intensive), and also varies with time (batch jobs come and go).
