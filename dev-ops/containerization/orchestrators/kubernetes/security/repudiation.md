## Repudiation

Repudiation is creating doubt about something, while non-repudiation is providing proof about something. In the context of information security, non-repudiation is proving certain actions were carried out by certain individuals.

You can enable auditing on your API server. You can also collect audit logs from container runtimes, kubelets, and applications running on your cluster.

Once multiple components are audited, you should push logs to a central store, such as deploying an agent to all nodes via a DaemonSet.
