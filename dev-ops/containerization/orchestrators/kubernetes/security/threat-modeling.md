## Thread Modeling

Thread modeling is the process of identifying vulnerabilities so you can put measures in place to prevent and mitigate them. The STRIDE model defines six categories of potential threat:

- Spoofing
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Elevation of privilege
