## Namespaces

Namespaces isolate different groups of resources and avoid name collisions by scoping the visibility of your resources. Can be used to divide resources between users and teams by appling **role-based access control**.

## ReplicaSets

Used to consistently replicate a Pod. If a Node/Pod goes offline, Kubernetes will automatically schedule a new Pod instance to maintain the specified replica count.
