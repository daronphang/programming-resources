## Containers

A container consists of an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package. By containerizing the application platform and its dependencies, differences in OS distributions and underlying infrastructure are abstracted away. Allows the application to run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Processes that run inside host OS and are not mini-VMs. Though VMs provide full process isolation, comes at computational overhead cost to virtualize. Containers provide most of isolation of VMs at fraction of computing power. Containers can be listening on same port without conflicts if they are published on different host ports i.e. 80:80 or 8080:80. To make port available to outside services, need to use -p flag.

### Container Workflow

1. Downloaded image 'nginx' from Docker Hub (if cannot find image locally).
2. Started a new container from that image.
3. Opened port 8080 on host IP (exposing host port).
4. Routes that traffic to container IP, port 80 (exposing container port).
5. Detach is to run server in background, gives unique container ID.
6. To connect from host to container, use curl or through browser with host IP + :8080.

```sh
$ docker container run --publish 8080:80 --detach <specify_name> nginx
$ docker container run -d --name nginx1 nginx
$ docker container run -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=true mysql

```

### Exposing vs Publishing Ports

EXPOSE is for documentation purposes in docker build; doesn't actually map or open any ports. PUBLISH flag makes container port available to outside world and maps container port to host port.

```sh
$ docker container run -p 80:5000 -d nginx
$ docker container run -p 8000-9000:5000 -d nginx      # Binds to randomly available port on host
```

### Container Commands

```console
$ docker run hello-world                    # For testing

$ docker container run --rm <image>         # Run and remove upon exit
$ docker container start                    # Start an existing stopped one

$ docker container stop 690                 # Type in first few digits of UID
$ docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)            # Stop all containers

$ docker container ls -a
$ docker container logs <ID_or_name>

$ docker container rm <ID_or_name>
$ docker container rm -f <ID_or_name>       # Force stop and remove container
$ docker container rm $(docker ls -a -q)

$ docker container top <name>                   # Display running process of specified container
$ docker container inspect <name>               # Details of one container config
$ docker container stats                        # Performance stats for all containers
$ docker container update <OPTIONS> <name>      # Change resources for given container

# get shell inside containers
$ docker container run -it --name proxy nginx sh
$ docker container run -it                     # Start new container with interactive shell
$ docker container exec -it <container> sh     # Run additional process in existing container
$ docker container start -ai
```

### Image vs Container

- Image is the application to run i.e. Nginx web server.
- Container is an instance of that image running as a process.
- Can have many containers running off the same image.
- Docker's default image 'registry/repository' is called Docker Hub.
- Container is a single read/write layer on top of image.

### Linux Distributions for Container Images

Alpine, Ubuntu.

## Container User

During Dockerfile build and running of containers, Docker will use root user by default. However, you cannot use usernames stored in the host machine as we cannot easily share usernames between a Docker host and its containers. Only usernames that exist on Docker container can be used i.e. nobody, root.

```sh
$ docker run --user=$(whoami)   # fails!

$ docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g)
```

To change user, you can specify any arbitrary UID. However, your user will be $HOME-less and nameless as we are asking Docker container to do things using the ID of a user it knows nothing about.

### Dockerfile

```dockerifle
USER UID:GID

RUN useradd -u 8877 john
USER john
```

### Mounting host volume

If the host directory contains spaces, wrap the volume argument with quotes to avoid throwing 'invalid reference error'.

```sh
$ docker run -v "$(pwd):/hello/world" --name orderapp orderapp:latest
```
