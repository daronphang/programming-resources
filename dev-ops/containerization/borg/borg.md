## Borg

Google's Borg system is a cluster manager that runs hundreds of thousands of jobs, from many different applications, across a number of clusters.

It achieves high utilization by combining admission control, efficient task-packing, over-commitment, and machine sharing with process-level performance isolation. It supports high-availability applications with runtime features that minimize fault-recovery time, and scheduling policies that reduce the probability of correlated failures.
