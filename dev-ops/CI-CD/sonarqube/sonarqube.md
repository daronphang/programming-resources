## SonarQube

Code quality and secure coding are critical of a DevOps CD pipeline. You can ensure quality on a number of fronts:

- Automated testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Giving attention to secure coding practices

Sonarqube detects bugs, vulnerabilities, and code issues. It can integrate with your workflow to enable continuous code inspection across your project branches and pull requests. The tool reports the overall health and quality of your source code and highlights issues that are found in new code. The code analyzers detect tricky bugs, such as non-pointer deferences, logic errors, and resource leaks.

### Integration

SonarQube provides SonarScanners for analyzing source code that is built with Gradle, Maven, Jenkins, and other build tools.
