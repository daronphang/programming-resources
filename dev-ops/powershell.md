## PowerShell

Powershell is a cross-platform task automation solution made up of command-line shell, scripting language, and a configuration management framework. Much more powerful than CMD. A Shell is a user interface that gives access to various services of OS. Can be installed on Windows, Linux and Mac. Used for task automation and configuration management. Commands are called cmdlets.

CMD is original shell for Microsoft OS. Powershell is new shell that replaces old CMD functionality with new scripting, allowing users to automate complicated tasks with reusable scripts. PowerShell uses cmdlets which are self-contained programming objects that expose the underlying admin options inside of Windows. Used mainly by IT administrators. For example, implementing new security solution dependent on a specific service that has to run on all servers; checking if each server has specific service installed can be tedious, but PowerShell scripting helps to automate this.
