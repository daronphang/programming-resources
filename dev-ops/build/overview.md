## Build

The build is a process of preparing source code for production so that users can happily interact with it. It may include compliation, file compression, updating database schema, creating an installer/executable file, etc.

Compiled languages would require build tools to produce a program that can be run and be tested by the CI system. However, interpreted langauges such as Python do not require build tools.

### Tooling

Make, Ant, Maven, Gradle and Bazel are a few known examples for build tools.
