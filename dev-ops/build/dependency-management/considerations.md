## Considerations When Importing

Questions to encourage engineers before importing dependencies are as follows:

- Does the project have tests that you can run?
- Do those tests pass?
- Who is providing that dependency?
- What sort of compatibility is the project aspiring to?
- Does the project detail what sort of usage is expected to be supported?
- How popular is the project?
- How long will we be depending on this project?
- How often does the project make breaking changes?
- How complicated would it be to implement that functionality internally?
- What incentives will we have to keep this dependency up to date?
- Who will perform an upgrade?
- How difficult do we expect it to be to perform an upgrade?
