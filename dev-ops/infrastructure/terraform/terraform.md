## Terraform

HashiCorp Terraform is an IaC tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

### IaC

Traditionally, the process of preparing a Windows or Linux server for your lab or data center consisted of several steps involving mouse clicks, running scripts, and manually configuring different aspects such as storage and networking. Doing this at scale for hundreds or thousands of servers becomes increasingly complex and error-prone.

IaC makes this process much easier by allowing you to define and provision your infrastructure with the help of a declarative language. With this approach, you can gain consistency, repeatability, and enhanced reliability.

In addition to day one infrastructure setup, this approach also helps with the management of any changes that happen to your infrastructure along the way, commonly referred to as **drift management**.
