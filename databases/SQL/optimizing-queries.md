## Query Best Practices

- SELECT fields instead of using SELECT \*
- Avoid using SELECT DISTINCT by adding more SELECT fields as GROUPing is expensive and may be inaccurate
- When joining tables, exclude unncessary columns and perform query first before joining
- use WHERE instead of HAVING to define filters

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 AS TB1
INNER JOIN table2 AS TB2 ON TB1.col2 = TB2.col2
WHERE TB1 = 'hello'
AND TB2 = 'world'

-- optimized
SELECT * FROM table1 AS TB1
INNER JOIN (
SELECT col1 FROM table2 WHERE col1 = 'world'
) AS TB2 ON TB1.col2 = TB2.col2
WHERE TB1.col1 = 'hello'
```

## Indexing

Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval i.e. pointer to data in a table. Helps to speed up SELECT queries and WHERE clauses, but slows down data input with UPDATE and INSERT statements. Can be created/dropped without any effect on data.

Whether to create single/composite index depends on the columns used frequently in WHERE clause. Implicit indexes are indexes automatically created by database server when an object is created i.e. for PK/unique constraints.

```sql
-- single-column index
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1)

-- unique indexes; can be used for both performance and data integrity (no duplicates)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name)

-- composite indexes
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (col1, col2)
```

### Unique Indexes vs Constraint

- When a unique constraint is created, a unique index is also created.
- No functional difference between both of them.
- Boils down to preferred style/consistency where constraint is more for business rule and index for querying.
- Unique index can be disabled while constraint cannot be disabled.

### When to Avoid Indexes

- Indexes should not be used on small tables
- For tables that have frequent, large database UPDATES or INSERT operations.
- Indexes should not be used on columns that have high number of NULL values.
- Columns that are frequently manipulated should not be indexed.

## Removing Duplicates

### Row Number

```sql
WITH CTE (Col1, Col2, Col3, DuplicateCount)
AS
(
  SELECT Col1, Col2, Col3,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Col1, Col2,
       Col3 ORDER BY Col1) AS DuplicateCount
  FROM MyTable
) SELECT * from CTE Where DuplicateCount = 1
```

### Group By

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, MobileNo
FROM  CUSTOMER
GROUP BY FirstName, LastName, MobileNo;
```

### Self Join

```
emp_name   emp_address  sex  matial_status  
uuuu       eee          m    s
iiii       iii          f    s
uuuu       eee          m    s
```

```sql
-- use self join

SELECT emp_name, emp_address, sex, marital_status
FROM YourTable a
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 
  FROM YourTable b
  WHERE 
  b.emp_name = a.emp_name AND
  b.emp_address = a.emp_address AND
  b.sex = a.sex AND
  b.create_date >= a.create_date
)
```

### Using LAG

```sql
SELECT
    *,
    LAG(unique_row,1) OVER (ORDER BY event_note_datetime ASC) AS next_unique_row 
INTO #ETOSTATES2
FROM 
    #ETOSTATES

SELECT
    equip_id,
    equip_state,
    equip_semi_state,
    event_code,
    comments,
    event_note_datetime
FROM
    #ETOSTATES2
WHERE
    unique_row != next_unique_row
```
