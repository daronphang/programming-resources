## Blob storage

Blob storage is a type of cloud storage for unstructured data. A "blob," which is short for Binary Large Object, is a mass of data in binary form that does not necessarily conform to any file format. Blob storage keeps these masses of data in non-hierarchical storage areas called data lakes.

We can store photos, audio, videos, or other multimedia items there. Every type of data is stored as a blob. It follows a flat data organization pattern where there are no directories, sub-directories, and so on. Itâ€™s used by applications with a particular business requirement called write once, read many (WORM), which states that data can only be written once and that no one can change it. Blob store is extensively used by YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and so on.
