## DBMS (Database Management System)

DBMS is a software package that provides an interface for users to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database. DBMS are categorized to their data structures or types.

There are four types of DBMS: Hierarchical, Network, Relational and Object-Oriented.

### Hierarchical

Model data is organized in a tree-like structure. Data is stored hierarchically (top-down or bottom-up) format. Data is represented using a parent-child relationship. Parent may have many children, but each child has only one parent.

### Network

Allows each child to have multiple parents. Helps to address the need to model more complex relationships like many-to-many relationship. In this model, entities are organized in a graph which can be accessed through several paths.

### Relational

Model is based on normalizing data into tables. A table is a logical structure made up of rows and columns. Rows have no fixed order, while order of the columns is the order specified when the table was created. Relational models are stored in fixed structures and manipulated using SQL.

### Object-Oriented

Data is stored in the form of objects. The class structure displays data within it.

### DBMS Software

MySQL, Microsoft Access, Oracle, PostgreSQL, dBase, FoxPro, SqLite, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.
