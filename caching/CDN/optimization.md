### Measurement-based CDN selection

Selecting the top CDN for users gives good performance. One way is to have user conduct light-weighted instantaneous bandwidth measurement multiple times at the beginning, and assign users the best-performing CDN throughout.

### Using multiple CDNs simultaneously

Combining multiple CDNs in parallel can significantly improve the average bandwidth. Specifically, the aggregate bandwidth obtained by combining multiple CDNs is greater than the bandwidth of the single best CDN.
