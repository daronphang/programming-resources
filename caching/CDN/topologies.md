## CDN network topologies

CDN network topologies describe the structure and organization of the CDNâ€™s distributed network. Different topologies can be employed to optimize content delivery based on factors such as performance, reliability, and cost.

## Flat topology

In a flat topology, all edge servers in the CDN are directly connected to the origin server. This approach can be effective for smaller CDNs, but may not scale well as the network grows.

## Hierarchical topology

In a hierarchical topology, edge servers are organized into multiple tiers, with each tier being responsible for serving content to the tier below it. This approach can improve scalability by distributing the load among multiple levels of servers and reducing the number of direct connections to the origin server.

```
Origin server
Intermediate/regional server    Intermediate/regional server
Edge server Edge server Edge server Edge server
```

## Anycast topology

Uses Anycast IP addressing to route requests to the nearest (or best) instance of a service based on network routing protocols.

Multiple edge servers are assigned the same IP address. Network routers direct traffic to the closest or most responsive server.

### Anycast vs hierarchical

Anycast is ideal for scenarios requiring global reach with **minimal latency and high fault tolerance**, while Hierarchical topology is suited for environments needing **structured** content distribution with layered caching and control. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the CDN deployment and the content delivery goals.

## Mesh topology

In a mesh topology, edge servers are interconnected, allowing them to share content and load with each other. This approach can enhance the redundancy and fault tolerance of the CDN, as well as improve content delivery performance by reducing the need to fetch content from the origin server.

## Hybrid topology

A hybrid topology combines elements from various topologies to create an optimized CDN architecture tailored to specific needs. For example, a CDN could use a hierarchical structure for serving static content, while employing a mesh topology for dynamic content delivery.
