## HTML5

Most pages on the web today are built using HTML4. However, the biggest limitation is that if developers wanted to add content or features that were not supported by HTML, they would have to use non-standard proprietary technologies and require clients to install browser plugins e.g. Flash.

HTML5 was designed to **eliminate the need for non-standard proprietary technologies** i.e. without downloading browser plugins or software. Hence, you can create web applications that work offline, support high-definition video and animations, and know where you are geographically located. HTML5 was released in 2014.

### Benefits

- Makes code easier to read for users
- Reduces overlap between HTML, CSS and Javascript
- Promotes design responsiveness and consistency across browsers
- Supports multimedia without the need for additional plugins

## Features

### Inline SVG (scalable vector graphics)

With HTML4, you need Flash, Silverlight or another technology to add SVGs. With HTML5, you can add them directly using `<svg>` tag.

### Local web storage

HTML4 stores data locally using cookies. With HTML5, web storage is used in place of cookies through scripting API.
