## Deployment

Deciding the origin from which the CDN fetches the content and deploying the content in multiple storage systems can be challenging. And that includes initial CDN misconfiguration, which should be corrected as soon as they are discovered.

## Content and client security

Protecting your content from unauthorized access or tampering can be a challenge when using a CDN. Deploy a trusted security solution to keep bad actors out of your data and your users’ personal information.

## Resilience

Maintaining high availability and resilience in the face of network or infrastructure failures is crucial. After all, organizations deploy CDNs to help increase availability and reliability – so test your system to ensure it is in fact doing that for your organization.
