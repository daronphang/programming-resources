## Edge server

An edge server is a CDN server located at a PoP, responsible for caching and delivering content to end-users. These servers store cached copies of the content, reducing the need to fetch data from the origin server.

## Scrubber server

Filters out malicious traffic and protect against cyber threats like DDoS attacks.

## Origin server

The origin server is the primary server where the original content is stored. CDNs fetch content from the origin server and cache it on edge servers for faster delivery to end-users.

## Cache warming

Cache warming is the process of preloading content into the edge serverâ€™s cache before it is requested by users, ensuring that the content is available for fast delivery when it is needed.

## Content optimization tools

These tools pre-process and optimize content before caching and delivery, enhancing performance and reducing bandwidth usage.

## COS-hosted origin server (cloud object storage)

COS is a highly available, stable, and secure cloud storage service for enterprises and individual users. The origin server can put unstructured data in any amount and form into COS for easy management and processing. Data content can be stored on origin server hosted by COS both actively and passively. This helps significantly reduce the pressure on origin servers.
