## Monetization

In general, the reception and equipment hosting services are undertaken by telecom operators. CDN service providers mainly cover software system devices and operational support. The upstream of the CDN industry is content providers, and the downstream is end users. **Content providers** are the main purchasers of CDN services and the main source of customers for commercial CDN systems.

## Business service model

### CDN billing

CDN services generally have two billing methods:

- **Bandwidth billing**: Refers to transmission speed (bits/s)
- **Traffic billing**: Transmission quantity (bits)

As edge nodes distribute content from different source sites at the same time, they mainly use **domain names** as statistical indicators to summarize the traffic or bandwidth under a certain domain name and form a charging basis.

As bandwidth is constantly changing, it can be divided into two methods:

- **Peak billing**: Uses the highest point within a time period
- **95 billing**: Collects an average bandwidth (traffic divided by seconds) every 5 minutes within a billing cycle, discards the top 5% of billing values, and uses the remaining highest value as the billing basis

Other flexible business models include guaranteed bandwidth traffic billing, capped bandwidth billing, etc.
