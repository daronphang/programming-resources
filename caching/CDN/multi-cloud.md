## Multi-cloud CDN

A multi-cloud CDN is a strategy that leverages multiple cloud service providers to deliver content across various locations and platforms. This approach combines the capabilities of different CDN providers to enhance performance, reliability, and scalability.

A typical multi-cloud CDN setup might involve using a combination of CDNs from providers like Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, and Akamai. Traffic could be distributed based on factors such as geographic location, load balancing policies, and performance metrics.

## Benefits

### Performance improvement

Different CDNs might have stronger presence in different regions. By using multiple CDNs, you can ensure that your content is delivered from the closest and most optimized location for your users.

### Increased reliability

If one CDN provider experiences an outage or performance degradation, the other CDNs can continue to serve content, ensuring higher availability and reliability.

### Flexibility and vendor diversification

Using multiple CDN providers reduces dependency on a single vendor and allows organizations to choose specific providers based on their performance and cost-effectiveness.

### Improved security

Multi CDN provides an additional layer of security, as multiple CDN providers can be used to distribute content, reducing the risk of a security breach. This is particularly important for organizations that handle sensitive information, as it helps to ensure that data is protected and secure.

## Implementation

### DNS-based load balancing

DNS-based load balancing directs users to different CDN providers based on DNS resolution. This can be configured to route traffic to different CDNs based on user location or other factors.

### HTTP/HTTPS load balancing

Application-level load balancers or reverse proxies can distribute traffic among multiple CDNs based on various criteria such as response time, health checks, or load metrics.

## Practices

### Group content by type

By grouping content by type, organizations can ensure that the most appropriate CDN provider is delivering each type of content. For example, static content, such as images and HTML pages, may be best delivered by one CDN provider, while video content may be best delivered by another. This helps to ensure that each CDN provider is delivering the type of content that they are best suited to handle, improving overall performance.

### Institute consistent hashing of your working set

Consistent hashing is a way of distributing content across multiple CDN providers in a balanced manner. It involves dividing the content into segments and then mapping each segment to a specific CDN provider, based on their strengths and weaknesses.

### Establish consistent monitoring parameters

To effectively manage a multi CDN implementation, it is important to have a consistent approach to monitoring performance. This includes monitoring the performance of each CDN provider, as well as the overall performance of the multi CDN solution. This helps to quickly identify and address any issues that arise, and to ensure that the multi CDN solution is functioning optimally.

Use real-time traffic monitoring tools to gather data on performance, latency, and load. With this data, adjust routing dynamically across CDNs, ensuring optimal user experience by selecting the fastest, most reliable path at any given moment.
