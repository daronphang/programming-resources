## Hinted handoff

Hinted handoff is used by distributed systems to improve reliability and resiliency in the eventual consistency model, and is used by distributed databases such as Cassandra and Amazon Dynamo. Nonetheless, it can also be used in CDN to redirect the traffic to the targeted healthy nodes if they have a lower latency compared to the backup nodes.
