## Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)

GSLB is a technique used by CDN providers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple geographically dispersed servers or data centers.

The primary goal of GSLB is to ensure that user requests are routed to the server that can provide the best performance and availability. It typically considers the following factors:

- Geographic proximity
- Server load
- Network conditions

### DNS

For a CDN, the GSLB system is usually integrated into the CDNâ€™s overall DNS infrastructure, which works alongside the standard DNS hierarchy. In a CDN setup, the GSLB operates at the **authoritative DNS level**:

- In a CDN setup, the authoritative DNS servers are managed by the CDN provider and integrate the GSLB system
- The GSLB receives the DNS query and analyzes it based on factors e.g. user's location, server load, network conditions, etc.
- Based on the analysis, it selects the optimal CDN edge server to handle the request and returns its IP address to the local DNS resolver/recursor

### Advantages

The main advantage of DNS-based selection is **full control over where to place users**. It's not an organic placement method, and users are explicitly directed, leaving nothing to chance. If a data centre is overloaded you simply don't send users there.

### Disadvantages

The DNS server responds to the client based on the **IP of the DNS resolver**, not the actual client IP address. A client based in Europe could be configured to use a resolver in the USA. As a result, the data centre IP returned to the client will be based in the USA and not Europe.

There are also dragging issues with failover and performance issues with low DNS TTLs. Failing over with DNS is much slower than with, for example, pure BGP. BGP is designed to failover quickly.
