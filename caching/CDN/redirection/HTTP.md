## HTTP redirection

HTTP-based redirection involves the proxy server redirecting the client to a closer server using HTTP status codes such as 301 (Moved permanently) or 302 (Found). When the client sends a request to the proxy server, the server evaluates the clientâ€™s location and redirects the request to the nearest server for data retrieval.
