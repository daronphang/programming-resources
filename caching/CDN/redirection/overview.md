<tr>
<td>Performance</td>
<td>Reduce load with DNS caching</td>
<td>All requests route through system, performance becomes bottleneck</td>
<td>No single point of bottleneck with the help of IP network devices to complete load balancing</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Accuracy</td>
<td>If local DNS is set incorrectly, it will cause inaccurate positioning</td>
<td>Accurate positioning and high precision can be achieved</td>
<td>Proximity scheduling is accurate, but there may be delays in responding to dynamic information e.g. server health</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Efficiency</td>
<td>Approximately equal to the processing efficiency of DNS system</td>
<td>Relies on server's processing, requires high-performance hardware resources</td>
<td>Approximately equal to the efficiency of IP devices</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Scalability</td>
<td>Good scalability and versatility</td>
<td>Poor scalability and requires customized development for various application protocols</td>
<td>Good versatility, but limited scope of application</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Use cases</td>
<td>Web acceleration</td>
<td>Domestic streaming media CDN</td>
<td>No commercial use cases yet</td>
