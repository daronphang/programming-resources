## Routing prioritization

### Network distance

The distance between the user and the proxy server plays a crucial role. It depends on two main factors:

- Length of the Network Path: The physical distance between the user and the proxy server determines the network pathâ€™s length

- Capacity (Bandwidth) Limits: The capacity or bandwidth along the network path also impacts proximity; optimal proximity involves selecting the server with the shortest path and the highest available bandwidth

### Server load

If a group of proxy servers is experiencing high loads, the request routing system should redirect requests to servers with lower loads. This action helps balance the load across proxy servers and reduces response latency for users.
