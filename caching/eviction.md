## Eviction policies

Caches employ eviction policies to decide which content to remove when cache space is needed. This helps manage storage and ensures that the most relevant content is kept readily accessible.

- First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
- Last-In-Last-Out (LIFO)
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Most Recently Used (MRU)
- Least Frequently Used (LFU)
- Random Replacement (RR): Randomly selects a candidate item and discards it to make space when necessary
