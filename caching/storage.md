## Storage

Data on cache servers is typically stored using a combination of filesystems (disk I/O) and in-memory storage (RAM), depending on the specific implementation and the type of content being cached.

### Distributed storage

In larger cache architectures, there might be distributed filesystems or object storage solutions to manage and replicate cached content across multiple edge servers. This helps ensure reliability and availability.

The cache might use techniques such as **sharding and replication** to improve performance and fault tolerance.
