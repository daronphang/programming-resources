## Look-aside pattern

### Read

- Application requests data from cache
- Cache delivers data if available
- If data is not available (cache miss), application gets data from database and writes it to the cache for future requests (read aside)

### Write

After a particular key is updated in the database, the system doesnâ€™t directly update the corresponding value in the cache. Instead, it removes the data for that key from the cache entirely. This process is known as cache invalidation.

## Inline pattern

### Read

- Application requests data from cache
- Cache delivers data if available
- If data is not available (cache miss), cache retrieves data from database, caches it, and returns the value to the requesting application
