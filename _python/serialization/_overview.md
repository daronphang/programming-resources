### Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting app-level objects (classes, dictionaries) into a format that allows us to store or transmit the data such as JSON, CSV, YAML, XML, Binary, HDF5, and etc (either text-based or binary-based). In other words, serialization is the process of converting a structured object into a sequence of bytes which can be stored in a file system or database, or sent through the network.

### Deserialization

Deserialization is the reverse process whereby data such as dictionaries or JSON objects are converted back into app-level objects. Often used in web development when backend receives input data from frontend or retrieving data from database, and then converting them back into custom objects.

### Libraries

Several Python libraries that support both deserialization and serialization such as pickle, json, cattrs, and marshmallow.
