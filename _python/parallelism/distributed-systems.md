## Distributed Systems

Multiprocessor systems are known as tightly coupled systems as they share the same physical memory. In contrast, a distributed system is loosely coupled and is devoid of any shared phsyical memory. Interprocess communication (IPC) in tightly coupled system is inexpensive and can be ignored as compared to task execution times as it is achieved through reads and writes to the shared memory. However, in distributed systems, IPC is comparable to task-execution times.
