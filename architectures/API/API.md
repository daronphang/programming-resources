## API (Application Programming Interface)

An API is a set of programming code/instructions that enables data transmission between one software to another. API specifies the interface by which two applications communicate with each other. APIs can be considered as contracts where the documentation is an agreement between the parties i.e. if party A sends a remote request structured in a particular way, this is how party B's software will respond.

Each API contains and is implemented by functions calls i.e. language statements that request software to perform particular actions and services.

API enables companies to open up their applications' data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies. This allows services and products to communicate with each other and leverage each other's data and functionality. Developers do not need to know how an API is implemented; they simply use the interface to communicate with other products/services. Hence, APIs simplify software development and innovation by enabling applications to exchange data and functionality easily and securely.

### How an API works

APIs sit between an application and the web server, acting as the intermediary layer that processes data transfer between systems:

1. Client application that needs to access information or functionality initiates an API call known as a request. This request is processed from an application to the web server via API's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and includes a request verb, headers, and body.
2. After receiving a valid request, the API makes a call to the external program or web server.
3. The server sends a response to the API with requested information.
4. API transfers the data to the initial requesting application.

### Design

Most modern web applications expose APIs that clients can use to interact with the application. A well-designed web API should aim to support platform independence and service evolution.

#### Platform independence

Any client should be able to call the API, regardless of how the API is implemented internally. This requires using standard protocols, and having a mechanism whereby the client and the web service can agree on the format of the data to exchange.

#### Service evolution

The web API should be able to evolve and add functionality independently from client applications. As the API evolves, existing client applications should continue to function without modification. All functionality should be discoverable so that client applications can fully use it.

## Types of APIs

### Open APIs

Open-source APIs that are open to public and available for any third-party developers. Can be classified as either free-of-charge or commercial. Allows for increasing brand awareness and receiving an additional source of income when properly executed.

### Partner APIs

APIs that are exposed to business partners who have signed an agreement with the publisher. Common use case is software integration between two parties. A company that grants partners with access to data or capability benefits from extra revenue streams.

### Private APIs

APIs that remain hidden from the public and are intended to improve productivity and communication across different internal development teams.

### Composite APIs

APIs that combine multiple data or service APIs. These services allow developers to access several endpoints in a single call. Useful in microservices architecture where performing a single task may require information from several sources.

## Benefits

### Improved Collaboration

APIs enable integration so that platforms and applications can seamlessly communicate with each other. Through this integration, companies can automate workflow and improve workplace collaboration. Without APIs, many enterprises would lack connectivity and suffer from informational silos that compromise productivity and performance.

### Easier Innovation

APIs offer flexibility, allowing companies to make connections with new business partners, offer new services to the market, and access new markets.

### Data Monetization

If APIs grant access to valuable digital assets, you can monetize it by selling access.

### Added Security

APIs create an added layer of protection between your data and a server. Developers can further strengthen API security by using tokens, signatures, and TLS encryption, by implementing API gateways to manage and authenticate traffic, and by practicing effective API management.
