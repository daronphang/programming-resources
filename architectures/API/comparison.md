## REST

Architecture style

Considered a simpler alternative to SOAP which many developers find difficult to use as it requires writing a lot of code to complete every task and following XML structure for every message sent (verbose).

Not constrained by encoding format.

Unlike RPC, users are not required to know procedure names or specific parameters in a specific order.
