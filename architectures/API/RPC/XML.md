### XML (Extensible Markup Language)

In today's world, there are many applications built on different programming languages. Exchanging of data between applications is crucial in today's networked world. However, data exchange between heterogeneous applications would be complex.

One of the methods used to combat this complexity is to use XML as the intermediate language. XML is a simple and flexible text format widely used for data storage and exchange over the internet or other networks. XML defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that both humans and machines can read. Enforces strict validation and can be reliably processed by programs.

XML is a markup language similar to HTML, but without predefined tags to use. Instead, you define your own tags designed specifically for your needs. Essentially, HTML was designed to focus on the presentation of content, while XML was designed to store data as structured information.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<message>
    <warning>
         Hello World
    </warning>
</message>
```

### WSDL

WSDL is an XML notation for describing a web service. A WSDL definition tells a client how to compose a web service request and describes the interface that is provided by the web service provider.
