## Fallacies

A fallacy is something that is believed or assumed to be true but is not. The following apply to distributed architectures:

- The network is reliable
- Latency is zero
- Bandwidth is infinite (leading to stamp coupling)
- The network is secure
- There is only one administrator
- Transport cost is zero
- The network is homogeneous
