## Data Soverignty

An important rule for microservices architecture is that each microservice must own its domain data and logic under an autonomous lifecycle, with independent deployment per microservice. The data owned by each microservice is prviate to it and should only be accessed either synchronously through its API end points (REST, gRPC, SOAP) or asynchronously via messaging queues.

This approach naturally leads to **polyglot persistence**, which is the use of multiple data storage technologies within a single application.

It is fine for services to share the same physical database server. However, **they should not share the same schema, or read/write to the same set of database tables**.

## Challenges

- Redundancy across data stores as the same item of data can appear in multiple places i.e. analytics, reporting, archiving
- Need to consider how updates are propagated across services and to maange eventual consistency

## Approaches

- Embrace eventual consistency where possible, and understand the places in system where you need strong consistency or ACID transactions
- Store only the data that a service needs
- Use an event-driven architecture style
- A service that owns events should publish a schema that can be used to automate serializing and deserializing the events to avoid tight coupling between publishers and subscribers i.e. JSON, Protobuf, Avro
