### ELK Stack (Elasticsearch and Kibana)

ELK stack gives you the ability to aggregate logs from all your systems and applications, analyze them, and create visualizations for application and infrastructure monitoring, faster troubleshooting, security analytics, and more.

### Metrics Tracking Across Multiple Services

In a more complex environment, we will be provisioning new instances of our services frequently. Hence, we want a system to make it very easy to collect metrics from new hosts and looking it at in aggregated view. **Graphite** is one such system that exposes a very simple API and allows you to send metrics in real time. It then allows you to query those metrics and produce charts/displays to see what is happening.
