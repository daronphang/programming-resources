## Agile practices

The lack of effective practices leads to unpredictability, repeated error, and wasted effort. Customers are disappointed by slipping schedules, growing budgets, and poor quality.

Our fears motivate us to create a process that constrains our activities and demands certain outputs and artifacts. We draw these from past experience; however, projects are not so simple that a few constraints and artifacts can reliably prevent error. After many projects, we may find ourselves overloaded with a huge cumbersome process that greatly impedes our ability to get anything done.

## Agile alliance values

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

People are the most important ingredient of success. A good process will not save the project from failure if the team doesn't have strong players, but a bad process can make even the strongest of players ineffective.

A strong player may be an average programmer, but is someone who works well with others through communicating and interacting.

The right tools can be important to success e.g. compilers, IDEs. However, tools can be overemphasized, and an abundance of tools is just as a bad as a lack of tools.

### Working software over comprehensive documentation

Software without documentation is a disaster. Code is not the ideal medium for communicating the rationale and structure of a system. Rather, the team needs to produce human-readable documents that describe the system and the rationale for their design decisions.

However, too much documentation is worse than too little. Huge documents take a great deal of time to produce and keep in sync with code.

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Working closely with the customer is more important than what the contract outlies. Successful projects involve customer feedback on a regular and frequent basis. Rather than depending on a contract or a statement of work, the customer of the software works closely with the development team, providing frequent feedback on their efforts.

### Responding to change over following a plan

It is the ability to respond to change that often determines the success or failure of a software project. When we build plans, we need to make sure that our plans are flexible and ready to adapt to changes in the business and technology.
