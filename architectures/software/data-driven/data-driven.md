## Data-driven architecture

In a data-driven design architecture, the data controls the flow and logic of the application to change your programâ€™s logic and result. Typical characteristics of a data-driven architecture include:

- The state of its data primarily determines the application's state
- Data is stored in a centralized location i.e. database
- Different parts of the application access and modify the data through defined interfaces
- Data binding is often used to keep different parts of the user interface in sync with the underlying data
- Changes to the data can trigger updates to different parts of the application

A data-driven architecture is best suited for applications that rely heavily on managing and manipulating data. This approach focuses on storing, retrieving, and modifying data and the interactions between different parts of the application and the data. A data-driven architecture often includes a centralized data storage location, such as a database. It uses data binding and flow techniques to ensure consistency and synchronicity across the application.
