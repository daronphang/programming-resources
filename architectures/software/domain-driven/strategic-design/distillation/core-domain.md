## Core domain

In designing a large system, there are so many contributing components, all complicated and all absolutely necessary to success, that the essence of the business model, the real business asset, can be obscured and neglected.

A system that is **hard to understand is hard to change or extend**, and the effect of a change is hard to foresee. The consequences of this include:

- Forcing people to specialize; when developers confine their work to specific modules it further **reduces knowledge transfer**
- With compartmentalization of work, smooth integration of the system suffers, and flexibility of assigning work is lost
- Duplication crops up because a developer does not realize that some behavior already exists elsewhere, and so the system becomes even more complex

However, the harsh reality is that not all parts of the design are going to be equally refined. Priorities must be set.

Those parts of the model distinctive and central to the purposes of the intended applications make up the **core domain**. The core domain is where the **most value should be added in your system**.
