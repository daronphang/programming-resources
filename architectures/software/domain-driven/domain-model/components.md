## Modules

**Low coupling and high cohesion** are general design principles that apply as much to individual objects as to modules, but they are particularly important at this larger grain of modeling and design.

Modules and the smaller elements should coevolve. Modules tend to be chosen to organize an early form of the objects. After that, the objects tend to change in ways that keep it in the bounds of the existing module definition.

Modules are a **communications mechanism**. When you place classes together in a module, you are telling developers to think about them together. The module should reflect insight into the domain. Refine the model until the concepts partition according to high-level domain concepts and the corresponding code is decoupled as well. Give the modules names that become part of the ubiquitous language.

## Paradigms

For model-driven design, the dominant paradigm is **OOP**, as object modeling does strike a nice balance of simplicity and sophistication. It has also proven rich enough to capture important domain knowledge.

Equally important is the maturity of the developer community and the design culture itself. A project that adopts a novel paradigm may be unable to find developers with expertise in the technology, or with the experience to create effective models in the chosen paradigm. It may not be feasible to educate them in a reasonable amount of time because the patterns for making the most of the paradigm and technology havenâ€™t gelled yet.

## UML (Unified Modeling Language)

A UML diagram is a way visualize systems and software using UML. Software engineers create UML diagrams to understand the designs, code architecture, and proposed implementation of complex software systems. UML diagrams are also used to model workflows and business processes.
