## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

DDD is a collection of principles and patterns that help developers craft elegant object systems i.e. defines a methodology for structuring business logic. DDD focuses on modeling software to match a domainâ€™s complexity and nuances called **domain models**. It emphasizes a deep understanding and representation of the domain within the software. These models encapsulate complex business logic, closing the gap between business reality and code.

### Key Characteristics

- Ubiquitous language: DDD advocates for a common language shared between developers and domain experts
- Rich domain models: Focus is on developing a rich model that encapsulates business logic
- Bounded contexts: Divides the system into bounded contexts, each with its own domain model and logic
