## Requirements

In the context of system design interviews, understanding functional and non-functional requirements is key to showcasing your ability to design a system that meets both the specific actions it should perform and how it should perform them.

### Functional

These are the requirements that define what a system is supposed to do. They describe the various functions that the system must perform.

### Non-functional

These requirements describe how the system performs a task, rather than what tasks it performs. They are related to the quality attributes of the system. Examples include scalability, reliability, availability, security, performance, etc.
