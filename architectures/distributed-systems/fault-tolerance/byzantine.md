## Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)

Byzantine fault tolerance is a feature of a distributed network to reach consensus even when some of the nodes in the network fail to respond or respond with incorrect information. The object of a BFT mechanism is to safeguard against system failures by employing collective decision making (correct and faulty nodes) which aims to reduce the influence of faulty nodes.

It can be theoretically proven that a system with byzantine nodes can tolerate up to 1/3 of faulty nodes and still operate correctly.

### Byzantine general's problem

The byzantine problem refers to a group of generals. Each general has an army and a location surrounding a fortress, and they must decide as a group to attack or retreat.

If they all make the same decision, they are successful. However, if there's a miscommunication or treachery causing some generals to attack while the others retreat, then the battle is lost. These types of problems are known as Byzantine faults.
