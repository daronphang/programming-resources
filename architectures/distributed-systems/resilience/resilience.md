## Resilience

Resilience is the ability of a software system to recover from failures and continue to function correctly. Resilience does not mean avoiding failures, but rather **minimizing their impact and frequency**. A resilient system can handle different types of failures, such as hardware faults, network outages, software bugs, or malicious attacks, and adapt to changing conditions and requirements.
