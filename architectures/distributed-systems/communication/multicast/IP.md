## IP Multicast

Over the last decade, researchers have studied how group communication applications like audio and video conferencing, multi-party games, content distribution, and broadcasting can be supported using IP Multicast.

IP Multicast is a method of communication that transmits data packets from one sender to multiple recipients at the same time over an IP network, without the need to send a separate copy to each recipient. The three types of casting are:

- Unicast (one-to-one)
- Broadcast (one-to-all)
- Multicast (one-to-many)

However, it is yet to be widely deployed due to fundamental concerns related to scalability, and support for higher layer functionality like reliability and congestion control.
