## Fallacies

A fallacy is something that is believed or assumed to be true but is not. The following are false assumptions that many developers make when developing a distributed application for the first time:

- The network is reliable
- The network is secure
- The network is homogeneous
- The topology does not change
- Latency is zero
- Bandwidth is infinite (leading to stamp coupling)
- There is only one administrator
- Transport cost is zero

These assumptions relate to properties that are unique to distributed systems:

- Reliability
- Security
- Heterogeneity
- Topology of the network
- Latency and bandwidth
- Transport costs
- Administrative domains

When developing non-distributed applications, most of these issues will most likely not show up.
