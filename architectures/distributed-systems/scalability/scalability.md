## Scalability

A scalable application can increase its capacity as its load increases. The simplest way is to **scale up** by using more expensive hardware. However, it will eventually reach a performance ceiling.

The alternative is to **scale out** by distributing the load across multiple nodes. There are three categories of scalability patterns: functional decomposition, partitioning, and duplication.
