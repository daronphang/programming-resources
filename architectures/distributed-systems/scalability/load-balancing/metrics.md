## Metrics

### Simple

A simple metric to compute the load on a server is to take the **product of request latency and request rate**. This metric reflects the load incurred by the requests on the server. However, it may not be sufficient.

### Complex

For more complex monitoring, the CPU, network load, throttling, timeouts, and load can be used for smart load balancing.
