## Structure your logs appropriately

A typical microservices-based application might include several technology stacks. Should use a common structure across all services i.e. | as delimiter.

## Use a centralized log storage

Different services may span across different servers, and it would be a daunting task to implement logging in each microservice. Logs can be pushed to a centralized location so that they can be accessed in one place.

## Logs should be queryable

Use a correlation ID that is passed from one service to another if it is being called.

If using HTTP for API calls, can pass correlation ID in headers as 'X-Request-ID' or 'X-Correlation-ID'.

## Provide informative application logs

Logs should include the following information at bare minimum:

- Service name
- Username
- IP address
- Correlation ID
- Message received time in UTC
- Time taken
- Method name
- Call stack
