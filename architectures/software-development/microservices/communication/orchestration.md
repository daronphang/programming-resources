## Orchestration

With orchestration style, you rely on a central brain to guide and drive the process through a series of request/response calls i.e. one service controller handles all communications in a tightly coupled, synchronous manner.

The orchestrator is responsible for invoking and combining the services. The relationship between all participating services are described by a single endpoint i.e. composite service.
