### Service-Oriented Architecture

A design approach where multiple services (completely separate OS process) collaborate to provide some end set of capabilities. Communication between these services occurs via netowrk calls rather than method calls within a process boundary.

Emerged to combat the challenges of a monolithic application and aims to promote reusability of software i.e. two or more end-user applications.

### Challenges

Communication protocols (SOAP), vendor middleware, lack of guidance about service granularity, or wrong guidance on picking places to split your system.
