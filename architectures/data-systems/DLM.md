## Data Lifecycle Management (DLM)

Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) involves the management of Lifecycle Operations. This involves categorization of data, authoring lifecycle policies, automation of the various different actions, and monitoring for policy conformance.

The lifecycle operations encompass a wide variety, including:

- Operations applicable based on the age of data (e.g., move data not accessed for X months to cold storage, delete all data older than Y years)
- Operations applicable based on the type of data (e.g., delete all user Personal Identifiable Information (PII) corresponding to deleted user accounts, apply Access Control for all sensitive data)
- Operations applicable on a periodic basis (e.g., weekly backup of identified tables)
- Operations applicable on an on-demand basis (e.g., deletion of user data when user exercises ‘right to be forgotten’)
