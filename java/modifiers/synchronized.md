## synchronized

Java synchronization is used to make sure that only one thread can access the resource at a given point in time.

## Process Synchronization

Process Synchronization is a technique used to coordinate the execution of multiple processes. It ensures that the shared resources are safe and in order.

## Thread Synchronization

Thread Synchronization is used to coordinate and ordering of the execution of the threads in a multi-threaded program. There are two types:

- Mutual Exclusive
- Cooperation (Inter-thread communication in Java)

### Mutual Exclusive

Mutual Exclusive helps keep threads from interfering with one another while sharing data. There are three types:

- Synchronized method
- Synchronized block
- Static synchronization
