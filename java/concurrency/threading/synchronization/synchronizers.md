## Synchronizers

The java.util.concurrent package contains several classes that help manage a set of collaborating threads. These mechanisms have "canned functionality" for common rendezvous patterns between threads.

| Class            | What It Does                                                                                                                                 | Notes                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CyclicBarrier    | Allows a set of threads to wait until a predefined count of them has reached a common barrier, and then optionally executes a barrier action | Use when a number of threads need to complete before their results can be used. The barrier can be reused after the waiting threads have been released       |
| Phaser           | Like a cyclic barrier, but with a mutable party count                                                                                        | Introduced in Java SE7                                                                                                                                       |
| CountDownLatch   | Allows a set of threads to wait until a count has been decremented to 0                                                                      | Use when one or more threads need to wait until a specified number of events have occurred                                                                   |
| Exchanger        | Allows two threads to exchange objects when both are ready for the exchange                                                                  | Use when two threads work on two instances of the same data structure, with the first thread filling one instance and the second thread emptying the other   |
| Semaphore        | Allows a set of threads to wait until permits are available for proceeding                                                                   | Use to restrict the total number of threads that can access a resource. If the permit count is 1, use to block threads until another thread gives permission |
| SynchronousQueue | Allows a thread to hand off an object to another thread                                                                                      | Use to send an object from one thread to another when both are ready, without explicit synchronization                                                       |
