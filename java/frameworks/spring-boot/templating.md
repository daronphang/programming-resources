## Template Engines

Template engines provide a way for server-side applications to generate final pages that will be displayed and executed in the user's browser. These view technologies differ in approaches but generally provide the following:

- A template language and/or collection of tags that define inputs used by the template engine to produce the expected outcome
- A view resolver that determines the view/template to use to fulfill a requested resource

Spring Boot supports view technologies including ThymeLeaf, FreeMarker, Groovy Markup, and Mustache. ThymeLeaf is the most widely used and provides excellent support for both Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux applications.
