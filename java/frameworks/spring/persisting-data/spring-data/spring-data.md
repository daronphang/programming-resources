## Spring Data

Spring Data's mission is to provide a familiar and consistent programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store. Regardless of database engine or platform, its goal is to make developer's access to data as simple and powerful as possible.

A few of the most popular Spring Data projects include:

- Spring Data JPA (JPA persistence against a relational database)
- Spring Data MongoDB (document)
- Spring Data Neo4j (graph)
- Spring Data Redis
- Spring Data Cassandra

One of the most useful features provided by Spring Data for all those projects is the ability to automatically create repositories, based on a repository specification interface.
