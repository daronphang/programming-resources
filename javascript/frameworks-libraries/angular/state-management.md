## State Management

State management refers to how data is shared/communicated between components. The state of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.

Redux helps to solve the two most common problems in React:

- Extraneous props i.e. passing data many levels up the component tree which breaks single-responsibility issue
- Communication between interdependent components at different points of component tree

However, Angular is a complete framework and incoherent state management is solved with Dependency Injection system i.e. injecting services into components. Moreover, RxJs offers Behavioral Subject whereby you can define initial state.

## Summary

- Data flow must be unidirectional and predictable i.e. single source of truth (Angular strictly enforces this via input bindings)
- Stores offer better performance, testability, and has tooling ecosystem
- Angular offers Dependency Injection system which is bureaucracy-free, straightfoward, and simple
- Redux is most likely overkill in Angular and requires alot boilerplate code
- Don't overcomplicate things and solve problems that don't exist
- State is flexible in Angular i.e. local/global, mutable/immutable

When in doubt, refer to this quote: "You'll never know when you need Flux. If you aren't sure if you need it, you don't need it".
