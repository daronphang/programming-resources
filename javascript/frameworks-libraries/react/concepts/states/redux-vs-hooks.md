### Redux vs React Hooks (With New Additions useContext and useReducer)

- React hooks is the new way of handling state and lifecycle into React functional components without relying on classes.
- React hooks replace class components and render prop pattern.
- Redux is a library for managing global application state where state is transformed by giving user the ability to emit actions.
- Redux should be used in applications that have several features sharing chunks of same information.
- React hooks help to eliminate dependency on Redux for smaller apps, and for sharing small pieces of information across components.
- React hooks features help to handle local component state.
- Redux has its own hooks (useSelector and useDispatch) and offers ability to use middlewares like thunk and saga.
- Both should be seen as complements and are often used together in an application.
