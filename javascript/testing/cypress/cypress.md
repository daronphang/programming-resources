## Cypress

Cypress is for running E2E and testing UI specifically by interacting with it and making assertions on it. Can be used to test styling/layout where Jest is unable to in JSDOM. Calls to backend are generally stubbed. Implementing both Cypress and Jest provide a complete testing solution for frontend.
