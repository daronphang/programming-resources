### Pig

Pig introduces Pig Latin, a scripting language that lets you use SQL-like syntax to define your Map and Reduce steps. Highly extensible with user-defined functions (UDF). Can run on top of Tez which is much faster than MapReduce and hence, it does not suffer from performance issues as compared to running MapReduce directly.
