## Pragmatics on design principles

Perspectives from Martin Fowler:

- The term 'best practices' or 'design principles' should be avoided, but having good ideas for a given context is valid
- There are no free lunches, **all abstractions come at a cost**
- Design principles should:
  - Be violated sometimes
  - Are often at odds with each other
  - Often mixed together for something even better when used in isolation
  - Often overlap with other ones
  - Be violated sometimes

By calling something a principle, when you are pragmatic you will most likely violate it. Instead, replace the term 'principle' with 'guideline'.

Whether we call something a principle or a guideline, the ability to make an **informed decision to disregard a design principle** is a good place to strive towards.
