## Integers

GO provides both signed and unsigned integer arithmetic.

```
int8 int16 int32 int64
uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64

RANGE OF VALUES
signed integers     -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1)-1     int8 has -128 to 127
unsigned integers   0 to 2^n -1               int8 has 0 255, uses full range of bits for non-negative values
```
