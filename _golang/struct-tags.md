## Struct Tags

A struct tag is additional meta information inserted into struct fields. The meta data can be acquired through reflection. They usually provide information on how a struct field is encoded or decoded from a format.

```
encoding/json
encoding/xml
gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson
gorm.io/gorm
github.com/gocarina/gocsv
gopkg.in/yaml.v2
