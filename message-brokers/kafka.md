### Kafka

A distributed publish-subscribe messaging system. Instead of using data packets, it uses a data stream to deliver messages which are suitable for both offline and online message consumption. An open-source platform developed by Apache written in Scala and Java. Kafka aims to provide solutions for large scale event-driven systems.

### Features

#### High-Volume

Kafka works with a considerable volume of data in the data streams.

#### Scalability

Scales easily without downtime by handling scalability in all four dimensions i.e. event producers, event consumers, event connectors and event processors.

#### Fault Tolerance

Kafka connector can handle failures with three strategies summarized as fast-fail, ignore and requeue.

#### Durability

Uses a distributed commit log which means no cascade failure and messages are persisted on a disk as fast as possible.

#### Performance

Has high throughput for both publishing and subscribing to messages.
