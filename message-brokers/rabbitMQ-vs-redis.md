| RabbitMQ                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Redis                                                                                                                                                            |

| Dedicated message-broker. Widely used in implementations of highly centralized and distributed systems.                                                                                                            | Can function as a message broker, database and cache.                                                                                                            |
| Can be scaled up to send around 50K messages per second.                                                                                                                                                           | Can be scaled up to send around one million messages per second.                                                                                                 |
| Supports powerful message routing. Application sends one message and exchange will route it to a queue based on the routing key.                                                                                   | Producers don't want for acknowledgements from brokers and hence, brokers can write messages at very high rate resulting in higher throughput.                   |
| Can be easily configured to use SSL.                                                                                                                                                                               | Have to opt for SSL separately which is a paid service.                                                                                                          |
| Supports both persistent and transient messages. Preferred if messages are needed to be stored for re-process in case of failures.                                                                                 | Supports transient messages only. Preferred for real-time applications.                                                                                          |
| Inherently supports clustering and outperforms Redis in this aspect.                                                                                                                                               | Clustering was introduced in Redis 3.0.                                                                                                                          |
| Supports both point-to-point and pub-sub messaging techniques.                                                                                                                                                     | Supports only pub-sub mechanism and hence, doesn't guarantee message delivery i.e. if a subscriber isn't active, it won't receive the messages it subscribed to. |
| Handles large messages better than Redis.                                                                                                                                                                          | Better suited for smaller messages (high latency for larger messages >1 MB).                                                                                     |
| Guarantees delivery of messages and preferable when you can't afford messages loss (message durability and acknowledgements). Consumers send acknowledgements to producers after successfully consuming a message. | Doesn't slow down with the addition of new consumers.                                                                                                            |
