## Gateway

Combines the function of both a modem and router into one piece of hardware.

## Mesh Router

While traditional routers are singular, centralized access points, mesh WiFi routers are decentralized. Instead of a device connecting to a single gateway, mesh networks are created from multiple WiFi nodes that provide web connectivity.

Mesh WiFi is designed to eliminate WiFi dead-zone and boost WiFi coverage signal. The unit that links to the modem will become the main hub. The other units/nodes will then capture and rebroadcast the router's signal.
