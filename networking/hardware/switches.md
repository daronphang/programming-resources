## Network switches

A network switch connects devices within a network and forwards data packets to and from those devices. A switch only sends data to the single device it is intended for e.g. another switch, router, computer, etc.

Network switches can operate at either OSI layer 2 or layer 3. Layer 2 switches forward data based on the destination MAC address, while layer 3 switches forward data based on the destination IP address. Some switches are hybrid. Nonetheless, **most switches are layer 2 switches**. Layer 2 switches most often connect to the devices in their networks using Ethernet cables. Ethernet cables are physical cables that plug into devices via Ethernet ports.

### Switch vs router

Routers select paths for data packets to cross networks and reach their destinations by connecting different networks and **forwarding data from network to network** e.g. LANs, WANs, autonomous systems, etc.

Switches are only used for interconnecting devices and sending data to a single device, and not to networks of multiple devices.
