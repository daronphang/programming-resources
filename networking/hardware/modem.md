## Modem

Device that connects your home to your ISP (internet service provider) through a physical connection. The modem translates the data from your ISP into a format that your home network devices can use. Most modems have two connection ports: one that connects to your ISP, and another that connects to your router/computer.

### Types

- **Dial-up:** Uses phone line to connect to an ISP
- **DSL:** Digital subscriber line modem uses a phone line to connect but with much higher speeds than dial-up
- **Cable:** Uses a cable TV line to connect
