## Modem

Device that connects your home to your ISP (internet service provider) through a physical connection. The modem translates the data from your ISP into a format that your home network devices can use. Most modems have two connection ports: one that connects to your ISP, and another that connects to your router/computer.

### Types

- **Dial-up:** Uses phone line to connect to an ISP
- **DSL:** Digital subscriber line modem uses a phone line to connect but with much higher speeds than dial-up
- **Cable:** Uses a cable TV line to connect

## Router

When you have multiple devices that need to connect to the internet, you want to use those devices over WiFi, which requires a router. Your router connects those devices to your home network or WiFi network, which then enables your devices to communicate wirelessly and connect to the internet.

Other advantages of a router include:

- **Firewall protection:** Protects against outside threats
- **Network security:** Secures your home network by hiding the IP addresses of your devices from the public internet
- **Parental controls:** Restrict internet access for certain devices
- **Connecting to VPN:** Provides additional security and privacy for your home network

## Gateway

Combines the function of both a modem and router into one piece of hardware.

## Mesh Router

While traditional routers are singular, centralized access points, mesh WiFi routers are decentralized. Instead of a device connecting to a single gateway, mesh networks are created from multiple WiFi nodes that provide web connectivity.

Mesh WiFi is designed to eliminate WiFi dead-zone and boost WiFi coverage signal. The unit that links to the modem will become the main hub. The other units/nodes will then capture and rebroadcast the router's signal.
