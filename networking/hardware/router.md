## Router

When you have multiple devices that need to connect to the internet, you want to use those devices over WiFi, which requires a router. Your router connects those devices to your home network or WiFi network, which then enables your devices to communicate wirelessly and connect to the internet.

Other advantages of a router include:

- **Firewall protection:** Protects against outside threats
- **Network security:** Secures your home network by hiding the IP addresses of your devices from the public internet
- **Parental controls:** Restrict internet access for certain devices
- **Connecting to VPN:** Provides additional security and privacy for your home network
