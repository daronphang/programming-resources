## Overlay network

An overlay network is a virtual network that is built on top of an existing network infrastructure. It enables the creation of a separate logical network that can facilitate communication and data transfer among nodes, regardless of their physical location or the underlying network they are connected to. By creating this virtual layer, overlay networks can enhance security, improve performance, and support new services and applications more efficiently.Applications include VPNs, CDNs, and P2P networks.

### Key features

- **Abstraction**: They provide an abstraction layer that allows for more flexible routing and communication without needing changes to the underlying physical network
- **Decentralization**: Many overlay networks are designed to be decentralized, allowing for peer-to-peer communication among nodes
- **Protocol independence**: Overlay networks can use different protocols than those used by the underlying network, enabling diverse types of traffic and services
