## Point of Presence (PoP)

A PoP is a physical location that houses data center compute, storage and networking infrastructure where high-speed connections to the internet are established. It’s a destination where data from a user’s device given a specific use case or application, is sent to connect to the internet.

A PoP refers to a location, facility or access point that connects to and helps other devices establish connections to the internet. It houses servers, routers, network, switches, multiplexers and other network interface equipment. PoPs are located at co-location centers and Internet exchange points.

### Benefits

The main function of a PoP is to enable users to access the internet securely, at high performance, or other similar networks that are maintained by a specific service or enterprise application.

PoP also helps to store and cache static content. Instead of the user's requests traveling to a data centre in a far away location, they can request the content from the local PoP, which has a shorter distance. This decreases the number of RTTs (Round Trip Times), resulting in better application performance.

If the local PoP does not have the requested content available locally, it may request the content from the central data centre location. The local PoP and primary data centre are already talking to each other, enabling the reuse of an existing TCP connection, which provides low RTT and a maximum congestion window size. When the TCP maximum congestion window is at its peak, data can really start flowing between two endpoints.

### How they work

A PoP is an essential node in the vast network landscape. They operate by hosting networking equipment, such as routers and switches. They connect local users present at a campus or branch location to the wider internet, a specific network service or an enterprise application with the use of specific secure tunneling protocols present at the local network and/or on the end user device.

This connection is facilitated through various telecommunications services, most popularly high speed internet broadband. PoPs are strategically located to ensure optimal connectivity and performance, often situated in areas with high user density or where multiple network paths intersect.

By serving as the bridge between local networks and larger-scale network infrastructures, PoPs effectively streamline internet connectivity, enhancing speed and reducing latency for end-users.
