## Network Interface

A network interface is the point of interconnection between a computer and a private or public network. Can exist as either an NIC or implemented in software.

A network interface is the network-specific software that communicates with the network-specific device driver and the IP layer in order to provide the IP layer with a consistent interface to all network adapters that might be present.

From the networkâ€™s point of view, network interfaces are the endpoints of the network, as here the network packets are injected into, respectively retrieved from the network. As all endpoints of a network must be uniquely addressable, each network interface is assigned a unique number.

When you send a packet to an IP address, your route table decides which network interface that packet goes through. This is one of the first things that happens in the network stack.

## Network Interface Card (NIC)

An NIC is a hardware component without which a computer cannot be connected over a network. It is a circuit board installed in a computer that provides a dedicated network connection to the computer.

## eth0, wlan0

To avoid ambiguity when having multiple network cards in a system, eth0 defaults to the ethernet interface that is used when connecting to the internet via LAN cable connection. Similarly, when using WiFi, it uses wlan0 (WirelessLAN).

```sh
$ ifconfig
$ ip link list
```
