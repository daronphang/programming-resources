## Data Communication

Data communication is a process or act in which we can send or receive data. Two models are available: OSI Model and TCP/IP model.

Both are logical models and describe how information is transmitted between two devices across a network. Both models also define a set of layers, whereby each layer performs a specific set of functions to enable the transmission of data. Both models also use the concept of encapsulation, in which data is packaged into a series of headers and trailers that contain information about the data being transmitted and how it should be handled by the network.

## OSI vs TCP/IP

| OSI                                                                                                                                                                                        | TCP/IP                                                                                            |

| OSI is a generic, protocol independent standard, acting as a communication gateway between network and end-user. It is a conceptual framework that describes the functioning of a network. | TCP/IP is based on standard protocols around which the internet has developed.                    |
| Transport layer guarantees delivery of packets.                                                                                                                                            | Transport layer does not guarantee delivery of packets but is still more reliable.                |
| Follows vertical approach.                                                                                                                                                                 | Follows horizontal approach.                                                                      |
| Reference model around which networks are built. Generally used as a guidance tool to standardize hardware including router, switch, motherboard.                                          | A way of implementation of the OSI model. Helps you establish a connection between two computers. |
| Protocol independent.                                                                                                                                                                      | Protocol dependent.                                                                               |
