## Ethernet protocol

Ethernet protocol is used for message exchanges between ethernet-capable network interfaces. The protocol defines:

1. MAC address
2. Format of a L1 frame and L2 packet
3. Forwarding processes of packets

Ethernet is the most widely use Data Link Layer protocol (layer 2), where devices are linked by physical cables rather than wireless.
