### OSI vs TCP/IP

| OSI                                                                                                                                               | TCP/IP                                                                             |

| OSI is a generic, protocol independent standard, acting as a communication gateway between network and end-user.                                  | TCP/IP is based on standard protocols around which the internet has developed.     |
| Transport layer guarantees delivery of packets.                                                                                                   | Transport layer does not guarantee delivery of packets but is still more reliable. |
| Follows vertical approach.                                                                                                                        | Follows horizontal approach.                                                       |
| Reference model around which networks are built. Generally used as a guidance tool to standardize hardware including router, switch, motherboard. | A way of implementation of the OSI model.                                          |
