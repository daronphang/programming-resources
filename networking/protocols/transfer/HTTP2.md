## HTTP/2

HTTP/2 specification was published in 2015 and improved on the HTTP/1.1 design.

## Features

### Binary framing layer

HTTP/2 communication is divided into smaller messages and framed in binary format. Unlike text-based HTTP/1.1, it makes sending and receiving messages compact and efficient. Elements such as headers, methods, and verbs are encoded in the binary format during transmission.

### Multiple parallel requests

While HTTP/1.1 allows for processing just one request at a time, HTTP/2 supports multiple calls via the same channel. Moreover, communication is bidirectional i.e. a single connection can send both requests and responses at the same time.

### Streaming

Real-time communication with high performance is possible with HTTP/2 thanks to binary framing, whereby each stream is divided into frames that can be prioritized and run via a single TCP connection, reducing network utilization and processing load.

### Multiplexing
