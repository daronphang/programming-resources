## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

FTP is a standard network protocol used for transmitting files from one host to another over TCP/IP. Within the TCP/IP suite, FTP is considered an Application layer protocol.

Though the transfer of files can be managed with HTTP, those options lack the clarity of focus, precision and control that FTP enables.

FTP handles three data representations (8-binary data, ASCII 7-Bit, and EBCDIC 8-Bit) and moves files via one of three transmission modes (block, stream, and compressed.)

## FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure)

FTPS is an extension of FTP that supports TLS.

## SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)

Transfers various files via SSH, a client-server based protocol. The recipient of your files connects to the SSH server and authenticates the server with cryptographic keys (SSH keys) or a username/password combo.

SFTP is the safest file transfer protocol for data warehousing projects, with FTPS in second place.
