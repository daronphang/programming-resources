## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

TCP is defined as a connection-oriented communication protocol that allows computing devices and applications to send data via a network and verify its delivery. Relies on a three-way handshake (synchronization, synchronization acknowledgement and final acknowledgement).

Task of TCP is to carry packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of messages and data across networks.

Before sending data, client and server must establish a connection. The server must actively listen for client requests whenever a connection is established.

However, while TCP is an instinctively reliable protocol, the feedback mechanisms also result in a more significant overhead size i.e. consumes more bandwidth.

TCP dynamically adapts the rate of data transfer to the available network capacity. When it is idling, it does not consume any bandwidth.
