## Domain management (domain name management)

Domain management is the practice of keeping a portfolio of web domains active, registered, stable, and secured from a broad range of threats. Effective domain management includes renewing domain name registrations for all the domains within an organization’s portfolio, determining nameservers and hosting providers, and making adjustments to domain names and DNS settings when required.

Domain management teams may also monitor web searches for the domain, track similar domain names that may cause harm to the reputation or authority of a brand, and deploy and manage security solutions that protect the domain and DNS records.

### Why is domain management important?

Corporate domain names are the centerpiece of an organization’s online presence and are often equated with the brand, especially when the domain name is synonymous with the company name.

Threats like phishing or copycat sites can cause significant harm to customers, damaging relationships with the organization. Other threats like cybersquatting or counterfeit sellers may also degrade the credibility of a domain name and the brand.

### Threats to domains

- **Phishing websites**: Copycate sites that look and feel identical to a trusted brand and are registered under a similar domain
- **Cybersquatters**: Cybersquatting is the practice of registering, selling, or using a domain name to profit off the brand equity of someone else’s trademark
- **Missed renewals**: Registration for each domain must be renewed every few years; when renewal is missed, cybersquatters may quickly snap up the registration and sell it back for a hefty sum
- **Multiple registrars**: Problems often arise when an organization’s many domains are registered with a variety of registrars as tracking renewals become more difficult
