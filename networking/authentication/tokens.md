## Session-Based

1. User logs in and server creates a session ID for user in database or server memory
2. Session ID is a long, unique random string that doesn't contain any user information
3. Session ID is stored in a cookie in client's browser and is sent along with every request made
4. Server verifies with session data on cookie with session data stored on server-side
5. Session cookie gets deleted when client closes browser; however, web browsers may use session restoring to make it permanent

## Token-Based (JWT)

Widely used in RESTful APIs. Server generates encrypted JWT and sends it back to client. Client sends JWT in header as Bearer Token for every subsequent request.

Should be stored in httpOnly cookie as local storage is vulnerable to XSS attacks. For transporting tokens securely, should send it via an encrypted channel such as HTTPS.

### Storing JWT on Client-Side

Should not use local storage for various reasons:

- Can only store string data
- Synchronous operation which may slow down app's runtime
- Cannot be used by web workers
- Any JS code can access local storage and has no data protection whatsoever (huge security issue and vulnerable to XSS attacks)

Always store JWT inside httpOnly cookie (special cookie that's only sent in HTTP requests to server) and never accessible but still vulnerable to CSRF attacks. If tokens are stored in cookie, need to implement CSRF token to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery since any API call browser makes will include cookies and hence, be authenticated by default. CSRF tokens are generated each time browser loads a page and are verified for every POST request by default.

## Session vs JWT

- JWT scales better as tokens are stored on client-side while session uses server memory/database which requires additional querying
- JWT requires larger byte size (~51x compared to user session) and hence, requires more bandwidth
- JWT requires more computing power/time to validate signatures and not ideal for single-threaded environments
- JWTs are better for server-server and client-server communication in API services without needing to perform network validation
- JWTs can be used to store client claims i.e. ID, department, address, etc. that cannot be modified
- JWT is easier to implement as there are libraries in every language
- Cannot invalidate/revoke JWT tokens until they are expired i.e. JWTs are self-contained

## Hybrid Session & JWT

Session ID is stored on frontend. Backend validates session ID and replaces it with JWT token to authorize further requests. Advantages/disadvantages:

- Can easily revoke sessions
- Backend services can authorize requests based only on JWT token
- Skip logic and user flow when JWT token expires on frontend and needs a refresh
- However, authentication service will be under heavy pressure as JWT token is issued for each request

## Correct Comparisons

Session vs JWT and not Cookie vs JWT. Cookie vs Local Storage (storage mechanism).
