### Span Tag

Similar to div, but it is an inline element (stays on the current line) as compared to a block. Used mainly for styling and manipulating a particular text. Gives developers tight control over the styling and formmating of specific context. Also, span allows us to assign any global HTML attribute to a section of text or other inline page content.

```html
<p>This a <span class="crimson-text">crimson text</span> within others.</p>
```

### Span vs Div

Differences as follows:

-   div adds a line break after its closing tag while span does not.
-   div takes up full width of its container while span takes up the width of its inner content.
-   Cannot change width and height for span.
-   div elements are used to separate chunks of context, and span used to target a piece of text within it.
