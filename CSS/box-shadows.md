## Box Shadow

```
box-shadow: offset-x | offset-y| blur-radius | spread-radius | color
```

### inset

If not specified, the shadow is assumed to be a drop shadow (box raised above the content). The inset keyword changes the shadow to one inside the frame i.e. as if the content was debossed inside the box. Inset shadows are drawn inside the border, above the background, but below content.

### blur-radius

The bigger the blur, the bigger and lighter the shadow becomes.

### spread-radius

Positive values will cause the shadow to expand and grow bigger, while negative values will cause the shadow to shrink.
