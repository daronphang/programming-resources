## Large Language Model (LLM)

LLM is a type of AI program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks. LLMs are trained on huge sets of data. LLMs are built on neural networks called transformer models.

LLM uses a type of machine learning called **deep learning** in order to understand how characters, words, and sentences function together. Deep learning involves the probabilistic analysis of unstructured data, which eventually enables the deep learning model to recognize distinctions between pieces of content without human intervention.

LLMs are then further trained via tuning: they are fine-tuned or prompt-tuned to the particular task that the programmer wants them to do, such as interpreting questions and generating responses, or translating text from one language to another.

Examples of LLMs include ChatGPT, Bard (Google), Llama (Meta), Bing Chat (Microsoft), GitHub Copilot.

### Use cases

- Sentiment analysis
- DNA research
- Customer service
- Chatbots
- Online search

### Characteristics

- Ability to respond to unpredictable queries; uses data analysis to answer an unstructured question or prompt in a way that makes sense

### Challenges

- Information provide are as reliable as the data they ingest; false information results in hallucination
- LLMs can also be manipulated via malicious inputs to provide certain types of responses over others
- Presenting out-of-date or generic information when the user expects a specific, current response
- Creating a response from non-authoritative sources
