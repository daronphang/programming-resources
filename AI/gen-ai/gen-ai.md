## Generative AI

Generative AI is a branch of AI that uses machine learning techniques to generate new content that mimics the data it was trained on. The key idea is that GenAI models can learn patterns and relationships in a dataset well enough to **create entirely new images, text, audio, and video** that still adhere to the underlying patterns.

GenAI has become possible because of advancements in deep learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These methods enable models to develop a rich understanding of large datasets and produce strikingly realistic synthetic content.
