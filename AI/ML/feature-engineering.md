## Feature engineering

Model features are the inputs that machine learning (ML) models use during training and inference to make predictions. ML model accuracy relies on a precise set and composition of features. For example, in an ML application that recommends a music playlist, features could include song ratings, which songs were listened to previously, and song listening time. It can take significant engineering effort to create features.

Feature engineering involves the extraction and transformation of variables from raw data, such as price lists, product descriptions, and sales volumes so that you can use features for training and prediction. The steps required to engineer features include data extraction and cleansing and then feature creation and storage.

After raw input data has been processed by data engineers in the ETL phase to remove duplicates, fix missing values and formatting problems, it moves on to the Feature Engineering phase. In this phase, preprocessed data is transformed into features that accurately reflect the problem the ML model is trying to solve.
