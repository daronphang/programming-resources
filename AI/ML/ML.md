## Machine learning

Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to **analyze data**, learn from it, and **make predictions** and informed decisions based on the data.

Instead of needing to explicitly program every single rule for how a computer should behave, ML algorithms are designed to automatically learn and improve from experience. The ML models learn by examining training data and using statistical techniques to identify patterns, extract insights, and find relationships between inputs and outputs.
