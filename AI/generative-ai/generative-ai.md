## Generative AI

Generative AI is a branch of AI that uses machine learning techniques to generate new content that mimics the data it was trained on. The key idea is that GenAI models can learn patterns and relationships in a dataset well enough to **create entirely new images, text, audio, and video** that still adhere to the underlying patterns.

One of the breakthroughs with generative AI models is the ability to leverage different learning approaches, including unsupervised or semi-supervised learning for training. This has given organizations the ability to more easily and quickly leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to create foundation models.

Foundation models are used as a base for AI systems that can perform multiple tasks e.g. GPT-3, Stable Diffusion.
