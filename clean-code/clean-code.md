## Clean Code

- Code to be elegant and efficient
- Meaningful names
- Has unit and acceptance tests
- Straightforward logic to make it hard for bugs to hide
- Minimal dependencies to ease maintenance
- Complete error handling according to an articulated strategy (race conditions, memory leaks)
- Reduced duplication
- Early building of simply abstractions/interfaces
