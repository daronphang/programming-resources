## Transitions vs Animations

| CSS Transitions                                                    | CSS Animations                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Can only move from initial to final state (no intermediate steps)  | Allows intermediate steps in between                 |
| Can only run once                                                  | Can loop indefinitely                                |
| Requires a trigger to run i.e. mouse hover                         | Can be triggered manually or automatically           |
| Runs forward when triggered and in reverse when trigger is removed | Can run forward, in reverse, or alternate directions |
| Easier to use with JS                                              | More difficult to use with JS                        |
| Best for creating a simple change from one state to another        | Best for creating a complex series of movements      |
