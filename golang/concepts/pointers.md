## Pointers

A variable that is used to store the memory address of another variable (in hexadecimal format). Also termed as special variables. Pointers declared on types and variables are slightly different.

Default value or zero-value of a pointer (uninitialized) is always nil.

```
*operator   Dereferencing operator used to declare pointer variable and access the value stored in address
*type       Type description that means to work with a pointer to that type
&operator   Used to return the address of variable or to access the address of a variable to a pointer

0001            person{firstName: "Jim"}
address         value

Turn address into value with *address
Turn value into address with &value
```

## Purpose

Pointers are used for efficiency as everything in Golang is passed by value i.e. value passed to function is a copy and not the original object to avoid unintentionally changing data. However, there are times that the original object needs to be manipulated i.e. passing by reference instead of value.

- Variables are names given to a memory location where the actual data is stored
- To access stored data, need address of memory location
- For human readability, data can be accessed through variables instead of hexadecimal format
- Pointers are used to pass a variable's memory location and then dereference it for manipulation as needed
- Instead of copying large amount of data everytime it is passed, programmers can pass its address

```go
// Creating myPointer as Pointer to an int32 variable and initialize pointer with address of number1
// Pointer contains the address (hexadecimal) and not the value
var myPointer *int32 = &number1

func main() {
    i, j := 42, 2701

    p := &i             // point to i
    fmt.Println(*p)     // dereferenced, read i through pointer
    *p = 21             // modify value of i through pointer

    var creature string = "shark"
    var pointer *string = &creature

    fmt.Println("creature =", creature)   // Creature = shark
    fmt.Println("pointer =", pointer)     // pointer = 0xc0000721e0
    fmt.Println("*pointer =", *pointer)   // to print the value, need to dereference using *operator
    *pointer = "jellyfish"                // modifying value
}

func(pointerToPerson *person) updateName() {    // not an operator; arg must be a pointer to type person
    *pointerToPerson    // this is an operator; to manipulate the value the pointer is referencing
}
```

### When to use pointers

- If the function needs to modify its receiver
- When passing large amounts of data

### Dangling pointers

A dangling pointer occurs when a pointer refers to a memory that has already been freed. Go prevents this with its GC, ensuring that memory is not freed while it is still referenced. However, holding onto pointers longer than necessary can lead to increased memory usage and memory leaks.

## Value vs reference types

Reference types have a pointer pointing to the underlying value; any updates to the reference type will indirectly update the underlying value and hence, do not need to specifically reference a pointer. For value types, need to use pointers to change/update values.

### Value types

```
int
float
stirng
bool
structs
```

### Reference types

```
slices
maps
channels
pointers
functions
```
