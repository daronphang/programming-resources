## Method declarations

A method is declared with a variant of the ordinary function declaration in which an extra parameter appears before the function name. The parameter attaches the function to the type of that parameter. The extra parameter is called the method's receiver.

In GO, special names such as _this_ or _self_ are not used for the receiver but instead we choose receiver names. Common choice is the first letter of type name. In method call, receiver argument appears before method name. Selectors are used to select fields of struct type i.e. p.X and also select methods i.e. p.Distance; since both methods and fields inhabit the same name space, cannot declare as the same name.

Methods can be declared on any named type defined in same package i.e. slice, struct, etc. Take note that methods on a type can only be defined in the **same package**.

```go
package geometry

import "math"

type Point struct { X, Y float64 }

// traditional function, no conflict with method below
// declared as package-level function called geometry.Distance
func Distance(p, q Point) float64 {
  return math.Hypot(q.X-p.X, q.Y-p.Y)
}

// method of Point, p is receiver
// declared as method of type Point, Point.Distance
func (p Point) Distance (q Point) float64 {
  return math.Hypot(q.X-p.X, q.Y-p.Y)
}

p := Point{1, 2}
q := Point{4, 6}
fmt.Println(p.Distance(q))  // p.Distance is called a selector as it selects the appropriate Distance method for receiver p
```

## Methods with pointer receiver

As calling a function makes a copy of each argument value, or if it needs to update a variable, must pass address of variable instead of copying it. If the receiver p has a method which requires a pointer, compiler will perform an implicit &p on the variable if shorthand is used. Only works for variables including struct, array and slices.

In a realistic program, convention dictates that if any method of variable has a pointer receiver, then all methods should have a pointer receiver, even ones that don't strictly need it. If all methods of named type T have a receiver type T itself (not \*T), it is safe to copy instances of that type i.e. calling any of its methods makes a copy.

```go
func (p *Point) updateX(value float64) {
  *p.X = value
}


func (p *Point) ScaleBy(factor float64) {
  p.X *= factor
  p.Y *= factor
  // name of method: (*Point).ScaleBy
}

r := Point{1, 2}
r.ScaleBy(2)    // shorthand; compiler performs an implicit &p on the variable
fmt.Println(*r) // {2, 4}

// or this
p := Point{1, 2}
(&p).ScaleBy(2)
fmt.Println(p)  // {2,4}

Point{1, 2}.ScaleBy(2)    // compiler error; can't take address of Point literal

Point{1,2}.Distance(q)  // Point
pptr.ScaleBy(2)         // *Point
```

## Nil as receiver value

```go
type IntList struct {
  Value int
  Tail *intList
}

func (list *IntList) Sum() int {
  if list == nil {
    return 0
  }
  return list.Value + list.Tail.sum()
}
```

## Composing types by struct embedding

Can call methods of embedded Point field even though ColoredPoint has no declared methods. Variable of type ColoredPoint has all methods of Point, color.RGBA and additional methods declared on ColoredPoint directly. When calling a method, compiler looks for directly declared method, then for methods promoted once from ColoredPoint's, and then for methods promoted twice from within Point and RGBA, and so on. Compiler reports an error if two methods were promoted from the same rank.

```go
import "image/color"

type Point struct { X, Y float64 }

type ColoredPoint struct {
  Point               // Point embedded to provide X and Y fields
  Color color.RGBA
}

// calling Point methods
red := color.RGBA{255, 0, 0, 255}
var p = ColoredPoint(Point{1, 1}, red}
p.ScaleBy(2)
```

## Method values and expressions

Normally a method is selected and called in the same expression i.e. p.Distance(), but it is possible to separate these two operations.

```go
p := Point{1,2}
q := Point{4,6}

distanceFromP := p.Distance     // method value
fmt.Println(distanceFromP(q))   // 5; function can be invoked without a receiver value; only needs non-receiver arguments
// dont need p.Distance(q)

scaleP := p.ScaleBy
scaleP(2)   // p becomes (2,4)
```

```go
// method expression

p := Point{1,2}
q := Point{4,6}

distance := Point.Distance
// function's first parameter takes the place of receiver i.e p.Distance
fmt.Println(distance(p,q))    // 5
```

## Encapsulation

A variable or method of an object is said to be encapsulated if it is inaccessible to clients of the object i.e. information hiding. Go has only one mechanism to control the visibility of names: capitalized identifiers are exported from package in which they are defined, and uncapitalized names are not. To encapsulate an object, must make it a struct.

```go
type IntSet struct {
  words []uint64
}
```

Functions that modify internal values of a type or access are called getters/setters. In GO, usually omit the Get prefix for brevity, and extends to other prefixes including Fetch, Find, and Lookup.

```go
package log

type Logger struct {
  flags int
  prefix string
  // ...
}

funct(l *Logger) Flags() int          // getter
funct(l *Logger) SetFlags(flag int)   // setter
funct(l *Logger) Prefix() string
funct(l *Logger) SetPrefix(prefix string)

```
