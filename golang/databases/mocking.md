## Mocking databases

There are several ways to mock a database. Here are some popular strategies:

1. Using in-memory databases: Tools like SQLite in-memory, H2, Mongodb in-memory, or Redis can simulate a real database during tests
2. Using Mocking Libraries: GoMock, Testify/mock, Go-SqlMock, Datadog/go-sqlmock, or Mongomock can help mock database interfaces, enabling testing of data access code without an actual database
3. Database Sandboxing: Tools like Docker can create isolated containers, which can run instances of real databases filled with test data
4. Data Virtualization: This creates a lightweight copy of the database only with the necessary data for tests
