## GORM

GORM is a full-featured object-relational mapper (ORM) library for the Go language. It lets you write queries as Go code by calling various methods on objects, which GORM translates into SQL queries when interacting with the database.

ORMs also have the problem of being an impedance mismatch compared to the raw SQL most people are used to, meaning you’ve got the reference documentation open all day looking up how to do accomplish things when the equivalent SQL would’ve been automatic.
