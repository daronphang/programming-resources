## Fuzz tests

Fuzz testing is an exciting testing technique in which random input is used to discover bugs or edge cases. Goâ€™s fuzzing algorithm is smart because it will try to cover as many statements in your code as possible by generating many new input combinations.

```go
func FuzzFooer(f *testing.F) {
    f.Add(3)
    f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, a int) {
        Fooer(a)
    })
}
```
